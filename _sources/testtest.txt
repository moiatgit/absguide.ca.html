XXX  7.5. Testing Your Knowledge of Tests
#########################################

The systemwide ``      xinitrc     `` file can be used to launch the X
server. This file contains quite a number of *if/then* tests. The
following is excerpted from an "ancient" version of
``      xinitrc     `` ( *Red Hat 7.1* , or thereabouts).


.. code-block:: sh

    if [ -f $HOME/.Xclients ]; then
      exec $HOME/.Xclients
    elif [ -f /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients ]; then
      exec /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients
    else
         # failsafe settings.  Although we should never get here
         # (we provide fallbacks in Xclients as well) it can't hurt.
         xclock -geometry 100x100-5+5 &
         xterm -geometry 80x50-50+150 &
         if [ -f /usr/bin/netscape -a -f /usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html ]; then
                 netscape /usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html &
         fi
    fi



Explain the *test* constructs in the above snippet, then examine an
updated version of the file, ``      /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc     `` , and
analyze the *if/then* test constructs there. You may need to refer ahead
to the discussions of `grep <textproc.html#GREPREF>`__ ,
`sed <sedawk.html#SEDREF>`__ , and `regular
expressions <regexp.html#REGEXREF>`__ .
