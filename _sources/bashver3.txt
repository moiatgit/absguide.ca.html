XXX  37.2. Bash, version 3
##########################

On July 27, 2004, Chet Ramey released version 3 of Bash. This update
fixed quite a number of bugs and added new features.

Some of the more important added features:

-

   A new, more generalized **{a..z}** `brace
   expansion <special-chars.html#BRACEEXPREF>`__ operator.


   .. code-block:: sh

       #!/bin/bash

       for i in {1..10}
       #  Simpler and more straightforward than
       #+ for i in $(seq 10)
       do
         echo -n "$i "
       done

       echo

       # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10



       # Or just . . .

       echo {a..z}    #  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
       echo {e..m}    #  e f g h i j k l m
       echo {z..a}    #  z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
                      #  Works backwards, too.
       echo {25..30}  #  25 26 27 28 29 30
       echo {3..-2}   #  3 2 1 0 -1 -2
       echo {X..d}    #  X Y Z [  ] ^ _ ` a b c d
                      #  Shows (some of) the ASCII characters between Z and a,
                      #+ but don't rely on this type of behavior because . . .
       echo {]..a}    #  {]..a}
                      #  Why?


       # You can tack on prefixes and suffixes.
       echo "Number #"{1..4}, "..."
            # Number #1, Number #2, Number #3, Number #4, ...


       # You can concatenate brace-expansion sets.
       echo {1..3}{x..z}" +" "..."
            # 1x + 1y + 1z + 2x + 2y + 2z + 3x + 3y + 3z + ...
            # Generates an algebraic expression.
            # This could be used to find permutations.

       # You can nest brace-expansion sets.
       echo {{a..c},{1..3}}
            # a b c 1 2 3
            # The "comma operator" splices together strings.

       # ########## ######### ############ ########### ######### ###############
       # Unfortunately, brace expansion does not lend itself to parameterization.
       var1=1
       var2=5
       echo {$var1..$var2}   # {1..5}


       # Yet, as Emiliano G. points out, using "eval" overcomes this limitation.

       start=0
       end=10
       for index in $(eval echo {$start..$end})
       do
         echo -n "$index "   # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
       done

       echo



-  The **${!array[@]}** operator, which expands to all the indices of a
   given `array <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ .


   .. code-block:: sh

       #!/bin/bash

       Array=(element-zero element-one element-two element-three)

       echo ${Array[0]}   # element-zero
                          # First element of array.

       echo ${!Array[@]}  # 0 1 2 3
                          # All the indices of Array.

       for i in ${!Array[@]}
       do
         echo ${Array[i]} # element-zero
                          # element-one
                          # element-two
                          # element-three
                          #
                          # All the elements in Array.
       done



-

   The **=~** `Regular Expression <regexp.html#REGEXREF>`__ matching
   operator within a `double
   brackets <testconstructs.html#DBLBRACKETS>`__ test expression. (Perl
   has a similar operator.)


   .. code-block:: sh

       #!/bin/bash

       variable="This is a fine mess."

       echo "$variable"

       # Regex matching with =~ operator within [[ double brackets ]].
       if [[ "$variable" =~ T.........fin*es* ]]
       # NOTE: As of version 3.2 of Bash, expression to match no longer quoted.
       then
         echo "match found"
             # match found
       fi



   Or, more usefully:


   .. code-block:: sh

       #!/bin/bash

       input=$1


       if [[ "$input" =~ "[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" ]]
       #                 ^ NOTE: Quoting not necessary, as of version 3.2 of Bash.
       # NNN-NN-NNNN (where each N is a digit).
       then
         echo "Social Security number."
         # Process SSN.
       else
         echo "Not a Social Security number!"
         # Or, ask for corrected input.
       fi



   For additional examples of using the **=~** operator, see `Example
   A-29 <contributed-scripts.html#WHX>`__ , `Example
   19-14 <x17837.html#MAILBOXGREP>`__ , `Example
   A-35 <contributed-scripts.html#FINDSPLIT>`__ , and `Example
   A-24 <contributed-scripts.html#TOHTML>`__ .

-

   The new ``        set -o pipefail       `` option is useful for
   debugging `pipes <special-chars.html#PIPEREF>`__ . If this option is
   set, then the `exit status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`__ of a
   pipe is the exit status of the last command in the pipe to *fail*
   (return a non-zero value), rather than the actual final command in
   the pipe.

   See `Example 16-43 <communications.html#FC4UPD>`__ .



|Caution

The update to version 3 of Bash breaks a few scripts that worked under
earlier versions. *Test critical legacy scripts to make sure they still
work!*

As it happens, a couple of the scripts in the *Advanced Bash Scripting
Guide* had to be fixed up (see `Example
9-4 <internalvariables.html#TOUT>`__ , for instance).





  37.2.1. Bash, version 3.1
--------------------------

The version 3.1 update of Bash introduces a number of bugfixes and a few
minor changes.

-  The += operator is now permitted in in places where previously only
   the = assignment operator was recognized.


   .. code-block:: sh

       a=1
       echo $a        # 1

       a+=5           # Won't work under versions of Bash earlier than 3.1.
       echo $a        # 15

       a+=Hello
       echo $a        # 15Hello



   Here, += functions as a *string concatenation* operator. Note that
   its behavior in this particular context is different than within a
   `let <internal.html#LETREF>`__ construct.


   .. code-block:: sh

       a=1
       echo $a        # 1

       let a+=5       # Integer arithmetic, rather than string concatenation.
       echo $a        # 6

       let a+=Hello   # Doesn't "add" anything to a.
       echo $a        # 6



    Jeffrey Haemer points out that this concatenation operator can be
   quite useful. In this instance, we append a directory to the
   ``         $PATH        `` .


   .. code-block:: sh

       bash$ echo $PATH
       /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin/:/usr/games


       bash$ PATH+=:/opt/bin

       bash$ echo $PATH
       /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin/:/usr/games:/opt/bin






  37.2.2. Bash, version 3.2
--------------------------

This is pretty much a bugfix update.

-  In `*global* parameter
   substitutions <parameter-substitution.html#PSGLOB>`__ , the pattern
   no longer anchors at the start of the string.

-  The ``         --wordexp        `` option disables `process
   substitution <process-sub.html#PROCESSSUBREF>`__ .

-  The **=~** `Regular Expression match
   operator <bashver3.html#REGEXMATCHREF>`__ no longer requires
   `quoting <quoting.html#QUOTINGREF>`__ of the *pattern* within `[[ ...
   ]] <testconstructs.html#DBLBRACKETS>`__ .



.. caution::

   In fact, quoting in this context is *not* advisable as it may cause
   *regex* evaluation to fail. Chet Ramey states in the `Bash
   FAQ <biblio.html#BASHFAQ>`__ that quoting explicitly disables regex
   evaluation. See also the `Ubuntu Bug
   List <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/109931>`__ and
   `Wikinerds on Bash
   syntax <http://en.wikinerds.org/index.php/Bash_syntax_and_semantics>`__
   .

   Setting *shopt -s compat31* in a script causes reversion to the
   original behavior.
