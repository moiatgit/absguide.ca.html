XXX  9.1. Internal Variables
############################

Les *variables internes* s√≥n variables que afecten el comportament dels guions Bash.


``$BASH``
=========

    The path to the *Bash* binary itself


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $BASH
        /bin/bash



``$BASH_ENV``
=============

    An `environmental variable <othertypesv.html#ENVREF>`__ pointing to
    a Bash startup file to be read when a script is invoked

``$BASH_SUBSHELL``
==================

    A variable indicating the `subshell <subshells.html#SUBSHELLSREF>`__
    level. This is a new addition to Bash, `version
    3 <bashver3.html#BASH3REF>`__ .

    See `Example 21-1 <subshells.html#SUBSHELL>`__ for usage.

``$BASHPID``
============

    *Process ID* of the current instance of Bash. This is not the same
    as the `$$ <internalvariables.html#PROCCID>`__ variable, but it
    often gives the same result.


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash4$ echo $$
        11015


        bash4$ echo $BASHPID
        11015


        bash4$ ps axgrep bash4
        11015 pts/2    R      0:00 bash4




     But ...


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash4

        echo "\$\$ outside of subshell = $$"                              # 9602
        echo "\$BASH_SUBSHELL  outside of subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL"      # 0
        echo "\$BASHPID outside of subshell = $BASHPID"                   # 9602

        echo

        ( echo "\$\$ inside of subshell = $$"                             # 9602
          echo "\$BASH_SUBSHELL inside of subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL"      # 1
          echo "\$BASHPID inside of subshell = $BASHPID" )                # 9603
          # Note that $$ returns PID of parent process.



``$BASH_VERSINFO[n]``
=====================

    A 6-element `array <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ containing version
    information about the installed release of Bash. This is similar to
    ``         $BASH_VERSION        `` , below, but a bit more detailed.


    .. code-block:: sh

        # Bash version info:

        for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5
        do
          echo "BASH_VERSINFO[$n] = ${BASH_VERSINFO[$n]}"
        done

        # BASH_VERSINFO[0] = 3                      # Major version no.
        # BASH_VERSINFO[1] = 00                     # Minor version no.
        # BASH_VERSINFO[2] = 14                     # Patch level.
        # BASH_VERSINFO[3] = 1                      # Build version.
        # BASH_VERSINFO[4] = release                # Release status.
        # BASH_VERSINFO[5] = i386-redhat-linux-gnu  # Architecture
                                                    # (same as $MACHTYPE).



``$BASH_VERSION``
=================

    The version of Bash installed on the system


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $BASH_VERSION
        3.2.25(1)-release





    .. code-block:: sh

        tcsh% echo $BASH_VERSION
        BASH_VERSION: Undefined variable.




    Checking $BASH\_VERSION is a good method of determining which shell
    is running. `$SHELL <internalvariables.html#SHELLVARREF>`__ does not
    necessarily give the correct answer.

``$CDPATH``
===========

    A colon-separated list of search paths available to the
    `cd <internal.html#CDREF>`__ command, similar in function to the
    `$PATH <internalvariables.html#PATHREF>`__ variable for binaries.
    The ``         $CDPATH        `` variable may be set in the local
    ``          ~/.bashrc         `` <sample-bashrc.html#BASHRC>`__
    file.


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ cd bash-doc
        bash: cd: bash-doc: No such file or directory


        bash$ CDPATH=/usr/share/doc
        bash$ cd bash-doc
        /usr/share/doc/bash-doc


        bash$ echo $PWD
        /usr/share/doc/bash-doc




``$DIRSTACK``
=============

    The top value in the directory stack ` [1]
     <internalvariables.html#FTN.AEN4671>`__ (affected by
    `pushd <internal.html#PUSHDREF>`__ and
    `popd <internal.html#POPDREF>`__ )

    This builtin variable corresponds to the
    `dirs <internal.html#DIRSD>`__ command, however **dirs** shows the
    entire contents of the directory stack.

``$EDITOR``
===========

    The default editor invoked by a script, usually **vi** or **emacs**
    .

``$EUID``
=========

     "effective" user ID number

    Identification number of whatever identity the current user has
    assumed, perhaps by means of `su <system.html#SUREF>`__ .



.. caution::

    The ``            $EUID           `` is not necessarily the same as
    the `$UID <internalvariables.html#UIDREF>`__ .




``$FUNCNAME``
=============

    Name of the current function


    .. code-block:: sh

        xyz23 ()
        {
          echo "$FUNCNAME now executing."  # xyz23 now executing.
        }

        xyz23

        echo "FUNCNAME = $FUNCNAME"        # FUNCNAME =
                                           # Null value outside a function.



    See also `Example A-50 <contributed-scripts.html#USEGETOPT>`__ .

``$GLOBIGNORE``
===============

    A list of filename patterns to be excluded from matching in
    `globbing <globbingref.html>`__ .

``$GROUPS``
===========

    Groups current user belongs to

    This is a listing (array) of the group id numbers for current user,
    as recorded in
    ``          /etc/passwd         `` <files.html#DATAFILESREF1>`__
    and ``         /etc/group        `` .


    .. code-block:: sh

        root# echo $GROUPS
        0


        root# echo ${GROUPS[1]}
        1


        root# echo ${GROUPS[5]}
        6




``$HOME``
=========

    Home directory of the user, usually
    ``         /home/username        `` (see `Example
    10-7 <parameter-substitution.html#EX6>`__ )

``$HOSTNAME``
=============

    The `hostname <system.html#HNAMEREF>`__ command assigns the system
    host name at bootup in an init script. However, the
    ``         gethostname()        `` function sets the Bash internal
    variable ``         $HOSTNAME        `` . See also `Example
    10-7 <parameter-substitution.html#EX6>`__ .

``$HOSTTYPE``
=============

    host type

    Like `$MACHTYPE <internalvariables.html#MACHTYPEREF>`__ , identifies
    the system hardware.


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $HOSTTYPE
        i686



``$IFS``
========

    internal field separator

    This variable determines how Bash recognizes
    `fields <special-chars.html#FIELDREF>`__ , or word boundaries, when
    it interprets character strings.

    $IFS defaults to `whitespace <special-chars.html#WHITESPACEREF>`__
    (space, tab, and newline), but may be changed, for example, to parse
    a comma-separated data file. Note that
    `$\* <internalvariables.html#APPREF>`__ uses the first character
    held in ``         $IFS        `` . See `Example
    5-1 <quotingvar.html#WEIRDVARS>`__ .


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo "$IFS"

        (With $IFS set to default, a blank line displays.)



        bash$ echo "$IFS"cat -vte
         ^I$
         $
        (Show whitespace: here a single space, ^I [horizontal tab],
          and newline, and display "$" at end-of-line.)



        bash$ bash -c 'set w x y z; IFS=":-;"; echo "$*"'
        w:x:y:z
        (Read commands from string and assign any arguments to pos params.)




    Set ``         $IFS        `` to eliminate whitespace in
    `pathnames <special-chars.html#PATHNAMEREF>`__ .


    .. code-block:: sh

        IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"   # Per David Wheeler.





.. caution::

    ``            $IFS           `` does not handle whitespace the same
    as it does other characters.


Exemple 1. $IFS and whitespace
==============================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # ifs.sh


        var1="a+b+c"
        var2="d-e-f"
        var3="g,h,i"

        IFS=+
        # The plus sign will be interpreted as a separator.
        echo $var1     # a b c
        echo $var2     # d-e-f
        echo $var3     # g,h,i

        echo

        IFS="-"
        # The plus sign reverts to default interpretation.
        # The minus sign will be interpreted as a separator.
        echo $var1     # a+b+c

        echo $var3     # g,h,i

    (Many thanks, St√É¬©phane Chazelas, for clarification and above
    examples.)

    See also `Example 16-41 <communications.html#ISSPAMMER>`__ ,
    `Example 11-8 <loops1.html#BINGREP>`__ , and `Example
    19-14 <x17837.html#MAILBOXGREP>`__ for instructive examples of using
    ``         $IFS        `` .

``$IGNOREEOF``
==============

    Ignore EOF: how many end-of-files (control-D) the shell will ignore
    before logging out.

``$LC_COLLATE``
===============

    Often set in the
    ``          .bashrc         `` <sample-bashrc.html>`__ or
    ``         /etc/profile        `` files, this variable controls
    collation order in filename expansion and pattern matching. If
    mishandled, ``         LC_COLLATE        `` can cause unexpected
    results in `filename globbing <globbingref.html>`__ .



.. note::

    As of version 2.05 of Bash, filename globbing no longer
    distinguishes between lowercase and uppercase letters in a character
    range between brackets. For example, **ls [A-M]\*** would match both
    ``            File1.txt           `` and
    ``            file1.txt           `` . To revert to the customary
    behavior of bracket matching, set
    ``            LC_COLLATE           `` to
    ``            C           `` by an
    ``                         export LC_COLLATE=C                       ``
    in ``            /etc/profile           `` and/or
    ``            ~/.bashrc           `` .




``$LC_CTYPE``
=============

    This internal variable controls character interpretation in
    `globbing <globbingref.html>`__ and pattern matching.

``$LINENO``
===========

    This variable is the line number of the shell script in which this
    variable appears. It has significance only within the script in
    which it appears, and is chiefly useful for debugging purposes.


    .. code-block:: sh

        # *** BEGIN DEBUG BLOCK ***
        last_cmd_arg=$_  # Save it.

        echo "At line number $LINENO, variable \"v1\" = $v1"
        echo "Last command argument processed = $last_cmd_arg"
        # *** END DEBUG BLOCK ***



``$MACHTYPE``
=============

    machine type

    Identifies the system hardware.


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $MACHTYPE
        i686



``$OLDPWD``
===========

    Old working directory ( "OLD-Print-Working-Directory" , previous
    directory you were in).

``$OSTYPE``
===========

    operating system type


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $OSTYPE
        linux

.. _internalvariables_path:

``$PATH``
=========

    Path to binaries, usually ``         /usr/bin/        `` ,
    ``         /usr/X11R6/bin/        `` ,
    ``         /usr/local/bin        `` , etc.

    When given a command, the shell automatically does a hash table
    search on the directories listed in the *path* for the executable.
    The path is stored in the `environmental
    variable <othertypesv.html#ENVREF>`__ , ``         $PATH        `` ,
    a list of directories, separated by colons. Normally, the system
    stores the ``         $PATH        `` definition in
    ``         /etc/profile        `` and/or
    ``          ~/.bashrc         `` <sample-bashrc.html>`__ (see
    `Appendix H <files.html>`__ ).


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $PATH
        /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin



    ``                   PATH=${PATH}:/opt/bin                 ``
    appends the ``         /opt/bin        `` directory to the current
    path. In a script, it may be expedient to temporarily add a
    directory to the path in this way. When the script exits, this
    restores the original ``         $PATH        `` (a child process,
    such as a script, may not change the environment of the parent
    process, the shell).



.. note::

    The current "working directory" , ``            ./           `` , is
    usually omitted from the ``            $PATH           `` as a
    security measure.




``$PIPESTATUS``
===============

    `Array <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ variable holding `exit
    status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`__ (es) of last executed
    *foreground* `pipe <special-chars.html#PIPEREF>`__ .


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $PIPESTATUS
        0

        bash$ ls -albogus_command
        bash: bogus_command: command not found
        bash$ echo ${PIPESTATUS[1]}
        127

        bash$ ls -albogus_command
        bash: bogus_command: command not found
        bash$ echo $?
        127




    The members of the ``         $PIPESTATUS        `` array hold the
    exit status of each respective command executed in a pipe.
    ``         $PIPESTATUS[0]        `` holds the exit status of the
    first command in the pipe, ``         $PIPESTATUS[1]        `` the
    exit status of the second command, and so on.



.. caution::

    The ``            $PIPESTATUS           `` variable may contain an
    erroneous 0 value in a login shell (in releases prior to 3.0 of
    Bash).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    tcsh% bash

    bash$ who | grep nob
ody | sort
    bash$ echo ${PIPESTA
TUS[*]}
    0


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    The above lines contained in a script would produce the expected
    ``            0 1 0           `` output.

    Thank you, Wayne Pollock for pointing this out and supplying the
    above example.


    .. code-block:: sh

        0







.. note::

    The ``            $PIPESTATUS           `` variable gives unexpected
    results in some contexts.

    Chet Ramey attributes the above output to the behavior of
    `ls <basic.html#LSREF>`__ . If *ls* writes to a *pipe* whose output
    is not read, then
    ``                         SIGPIPE                       `` kills
    it, and its `exit status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`__ is 141
    . Otherwise its exit status is 0 , as expected. This likewise is the
    case for `tr <textproc.html#TRREF>`__ .

.. note::

    ``            $PIPESTATUS           `` is a "volatile" variable. It
    needs to be captured immediately after the pipe in question, before
    any other command intervenes.

.. note::

    The `pipefail option <bashver3.html#PIPEFAILREF>`__ may be useful in
    cases where ``            $PIPESTATUS           `` does not give the
    desired information.




``$PPID``
=========

    The ``         $PPID        `` of a process is the process ID (
    ``         pid        `` ) of its parent process. ` [2]
     <internalvariables.html#FTN.AEN5154>`__

    Compare this with the `pidof <system.html#PIDOFREF>`__ command.

``$PROMPT_COMMAND``
===================

    A variable holding a command to be executed just before the primary
    prompt, ``         $PS1        `` is to be displayed.

``$PS1``
========

    This is the main prompt, seen at the command-line.

``$PS2``
========

    The secondary prompt, seen when additional input is expected. It
    displays as ">" .

``$PS3``
========

    The tertiary prompt, displayed in a
    `select <testbranch.html#SELECTREF>`__ loop (see `Example
    11-30 <testbranch.html#EX31>`__ ).

``$PS4``
========

    The quartenary prompt, shown at the beginning of each line of output
    when invoking a script with the -x *[verbose trace]*
    `option <options.html#OPTIONSREF>`__ . It displays as "+" .

    As a debugging aid, it may be useful to embed diagnostic information
    in ``         $PS4        `` .


    .. code-block:: sh

        P4='$(read time junk < /proc/$$/schedstat; echo "@@@ $time @@@ " )'
        # Per suggestion by Erik Brandsberg.
        set -x
        # Various commands follow ...



.. _internalvars_pwd:

``$PWD``
========

    Working directory (directory you are in at the time)

    This is the analog to the `pwd <internal.html#PWD2REF>`__ builtin
    command.


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash

        E_WRONG_DIRECTORY=85

        clear # Clear the screen.

        TargetDirectory=/home/bozo/projects/GreatAmericanNovel

        cd $TargetDirectory
        echo "Deleting stale files in $TargetDirectory."

        if [ "$PWD" != "$TargetDirectory" ]
        then    # Keep from wiping out wrong directory by accident.
          echo "Wrong directory!"
          echo "In $PWD, rather than $TargetDirectory!"
          echo "Bailing out!"
          exit $E_WRONG_DIRECTORY
        fi

        rm -rf *
        rm .[A-Za-z0-9]*    # Delete dotfiles.
        # rm -f .[^.]* ..?*   to remove filenames beginning with multiple dots.
        # (shopt -s dotglob; rm -f *)   will also work.
        # Thanks, S.C. for pointing this out.

        #  A filename (`basename`) may contain all characters in the 0 - 255 range,
        #+ except "/".
        #  Deleting files beginning with weird characters, such as -
        #+ is left as an exercise. (Hint: rm ./-weirdname or rm -- -weirdname)
        result=$?   # Result of delete operations. If successful = 0.

        echo
        ls -al              # Any files left?
        echo "Done."
        echo "Old files deleted in $TargetDirectory."
        echo

        # Various other operations here, as necessary.

        exit $result



``$REPLY``
==========

    The default value when a variable is not supplied to
    `read <internal.html#READREF>`__ . Also applicable to
    `select <testbranch.html#SELECTREF>`__ menus, but only supplies the
    item number of the variable chosen, not the value of the variable
    itself.


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # reply.sh

        # REPLY is the default value for a 'read' command.

        echo
        echo -n "What is your favorite vegetable? "
        read

        echo "Your favorite vegetable is $REPLY."
        #  REPLY holds the value of last "read" if and only if
        #+ no variable supplied.

        echo
        echo -n "What is your favorite fruit? "
        read fruit
        echo "Your favorite fruit is $fruit."
        echo "but..."
        echo "Value of \$REPLY is still $REPLY."
        #  $REPLY is still set to its previous value because
        #+ the variable $fruit absorbed the new "read" value.

        echo

        exit 0



``$SECONDS``
============

    The number of seconds the script has been running.


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash

        TIME_LIMIT=10
        INTERVAL=1

        echo
        echo "Hit Control-C to exit before $TIME_LIMIT seconds."
        echo

        while [ "$SECONDS" -le "$TIME_LIMIT" ]
        do   #   $SECONDS is an internal shell variable.
          if [ "$SECONDS" -eq 1 ]
          then
            units=second
          else
            units=seconds
          fi

          echo "This script has been running $SECONDS $units."
          #  On a slow or overburdened machine, the script may skip a count
          #+ every once in a while.
          sleep $INTERVAL
        done

        echo -e "\a"  # Beep!

        exit 0



``$SHELLOPTS``
==============

    The list of enabled shell `options <options.html#OPTIONSREF>`__ , a
    readonly variable.


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ echo $SHELLOPTS
        braceexpand:hashall:histexpand:monitor:history:interactive-comments:emacs




``$SHLVL``
==========

    Shell level, how deeply Bash is nested. ` [3]
     <internalvariables.html#FTN.AEN5320>`__ If, at the command-line,
    $SHLVL is 1, then in a script it will increment to 2.



.. note::

    This variable is `*not* affected by
    subshells <subshells.html#SUBSHNLEVREF>`__ . Use
    `$BASH\_SUBSHELL <internalvariables.html#BASHSUBSHELLREF>`__ when
    you need an indication of subshell nesting.




``$TMOUT``
==========

    If the ``                   $TMOUT                 `` environmental
    variable is set to a non-zero value ``         time        `` , then
    the shell prompt will time out after``$time``
    seconds. This will cause a logout.

    As of version 2.05b of Bash, it is now possible to use
    ``                   $TMOUT                 `` in a script in
    combination with `read <internal.html#READREF>`__ .


    .. code-block:: sh

        # Works in scripts for Bash, versions 2.05b and later.

        TMOUT=3    # Prompt times out at three seconds.

        echo "What is your favorite song?"
        echo "Quickly now, you only have $TMOUT seconds to answer!"
        read song

        if [ -z "$song" ]
        then
          song="(no answer)"
          # Default response.
        fi

        echo "Your favorite song is $song."



    There are other, more complex, ways of implementing timed input in a
    script. One alternative is to set up a timing loop to signal the
    script when it times out. This also requires a signal handling
    routine to `trap <debugging.html#TRAPREF1>`__ (see `Example
    32-5 <debugging.html#EX76>`__ ) the interrupt generated by the
    timing loop (whew!).


Exemple 2. Timed Input
======================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # timed-input.sh

        # TMOUT=3    Also works, as of newer versions of Bash.

        TIMER_INTERRUPT=14
        TIMELIMIT=3  # Three seconds in this instance.
                     # May be set to different value.

        PrintAnswer()
        {
          if [ "$answer" = TIMEOUT ]
          then
            echo $answer
          else       # Don't want to mix up the two instances.
            echo "Your favorite veggie is $answer"
            kill $!  #  Kills no-longer-needed TimerOn function
                     #+ running in background.
                     #  $! is PID of last job running in background.
          fi

        }


        TimerOn()
        {
          sleep $TIMELIMIT && kill -s 14 $$ &
          # Waits 3 seconds, then sends sigalarm to script.
        }


        Int14Vector()
        {
          answer="TIMEOUT"
          PrintAnswer
          exit $TIMER_INTERRUPT
        }

        trap Int14Vector $TIMER_INTERRUPT
        # Timer interrupt (14) subverted for our purposes.

        echo "What is your favorite vegetable "
        TimerOn
        read answer
        PrintAnswer


        #  Admittedly, this is a kludgy implementation of timed input.
        #  However, the "-t" option to "read" simplifies this task.
        #  See the "t-out.sh" script.
        #  However, what about timing not just single user input,
        #+ but an entire script?

        #  If you need something really elegant ...
        #+ consider writing the application in C or C++,
        #+ using appropriate library functions, such as 'alarm' and 'setitimer.'

        exit 0




    An alternative is using `stty <system.html#STTYREF>`__ .


Exemple 3. Once more, timed input
=================================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # timeout.sh

        #  Written by Stephane Chazelas,
        #+ and modified by the document author.

        INTERVAL=5                # timeout interval

        timedout_read() {
          timeout=$1
          varname=$2
          old_tty_settings=`stty -g`
          stty -icanon min 0 time ${timeout}0
          eval read $varname      # or just  read $varname
          stty "$old_tty_settings"
          # See man page for "stty."
        }

        echo; echo -n "What's your name? Quick! "
        timedout_read $INTERVAL your_name

        #  This may not work on every terminal type.
        #  The maximum timeout depends on the terminal.
        #+ (it is often 25.5 seconds).

        echo

        if [ ! -z "$your_name" ]  # If name input before timeout ...
        then
          echo "Your name is $your_name."
        else
          echo "Timed out."
        fi

        echo

        # The behavior of this script differs somewhat from "timed-input.sh."
        # At each keystroke, the counter resets.

        exit 0




    Perhaps the simplest method is using the ``         -t        ``
    option to `read <internal.html#READREF>`__ .


Exemple 4. Timed *read*
=======================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # t-out.sh [time-out]
        # Inspired by a suggestion from "syngin seven" (thanks).


        TIMELIMIT=4         # 4 seconds

        read -t $TIMELIMIT variable <&1
        #                           ^^^
        #  In this instance, "<&1" is needed for Bash 1.x and 2.x,
        #  but unnecessary for Bash 3+.

        echo

        if [ -z "$variable" ]  # Is null?
        then
          echo "Timed out, variable still unset."
        else
          echo "variable = $variable"
        fi

        exit 0




``$UID``
========

    User ID number

    Current user's user identification number, as recorded in
    ``          /etc/passwd         `` <files.html#DATAFILESREF1>`__

    This is the current user's real id, even if she has temporarily
    assumed another identity through `su <system.html#SUREF>`__ .
    ``         $UID        `` is a readonly variable, not subject to
    change from the command line or within a script, and is the
    counterpart to the `id <system.html#IDREF>`__ builtin.


Exemple 5. Am I root?
=====================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # am-i-root.sh:   Am I root or not?

        ROOT_UID=0   # Root has $UID 0.

        if [ "$UID" -eq "$ROOT_UID" ]  # Will the real "root" please stand up?
        then
          echo "You are root."
        else
          echo "You are just an ordinary user (but mom loves you just the same)."
        fi

        exit 0


        # ============================================================= #
        # Code below will not execute, because the script already exited.

        # An alternate method of getting to the root of matters:

        ROOTUSER_NAME=root

        username=`id -nu`              # Or...   username=`whoami`
        if [ "$username" = "$ROOTUSER_NAME" ]
        then
          echo "Rooty, toot, toot. You are root."
        else
          echo "You are just a regular fella."
        fi

.. note::

    The variables ``            $ENV           `` ,
    ``            $LOGNAME           `` ,
    ``            $MAIL           `` ,``$TERM``
    , ``            $USER           `` , and
    ``            $USERNAME           `` are *not* Bash
    `builtins <internal.html#BUILTINREF>`__ . These are, however, often
    set as `environmental variables <othertypesv.html#ENVREF>`__ in one
    of the `Bash <files.html#FILESREF1>`__ or *login* startup files.
    ``            $SHELL           `` , the name of the user's login

Par√†metres posicionals
======================

 ``        $0       `` , ``        $1       `` , ``        $2       `` ,
etc.
    Positional parameters, passed from command line to script, passed to
    a function, or `set <internal.html#SETREF>`__ to a variable (see
    `Example 4-5 <othertypesv.html#EX17>`__ and `Example
    15-16 <internal.html#EX34>`__ )

 ``        $#       ``
    Number of command-line arguments ` [4]
     <internalvariables.html#FTN.AEN5479>`__ or positional parameters
    (see `Example 36-2 <wrapper.html#EX4>`__ )

 ``        $*       ``
    All of the positional parameters, seen as a single word



.. note::

     " ``             $*            `` " must be quoted.




 ``        $@       ``
    Same as $\* , but each parameter is a quoted string, that is, the
    parameters are passed on intact, without interpretation or
    expansion. This means, among other things, that each parameter in
    the argument list is seen as a separate word.



.. note::

    Of course, " ``             $@            `` " should be quoted.





Exemple 6. *arglist* : Listing arguments with $\* and $@
========================================================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # arglist.sh
        # Invoke this script with several arguments, such as "one two three" ...

        E_BADARGS=85

        if [ ! -n "$1" ]
        then
          echo "Usage: `basename $0` argument1 argument2 etc."
          exit $E_BADARGS
        fi

        echo

        index=1          # Initialize count.

        echo "Listing args with \"\$*\":"
        for arg in "$*"  # Doesn't work properly if "$*" isn't quoted.
        do
          echo "Arg #$index = $arg"
          let "index+=1"
        done             # $* sees all arguments as single word.
        echo "Entire arg list seen as single word."

        echo

        index=1          # Reset count.
                         # What happens if you forget to do this?

        echo "Listing args with \"\$@\":"
        for arg in "$@"
        do
          echo "Arg #$index = $arg"
          let "index+=1"
        done             # $@ sees arguments as separate words.
        echo "Arg list seen as separate words."

        echo

        index=1          # Reset count.

        echo "Listing args with \$* (unquoted):"
        for arg in $*
        do
          echo "Arg #$index = $arg"
          let "index+=1"
        done             # Unquoted $* sees arguments as separate words.
        echo "Arg list seen as separate words."

        exit 0




    Following a **shift** , the ``         $@        `` holds the
    remaining command-line parameters, lacking the previous
    ``         $1        `` , which was lost.


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # Invoke with ./scriptname 1 2 3 4 5

        echo "$@"    # 1 2 3 4 5
        shift
        echo "$@"    # 2 3 4 5
        shift
        echo "$@"    # 3 4 5

        # Each "shift" loses parameter $1.
        # "$@" then contains the remaining parameters.



    The ``         $@        `` special parameter finds use as a tool
    for filtering input into shell scripts. The **cat "$@"**
    construction accepts input to a script either from
    ``         stdin        `` or from files given as parameters to the
    script. See `Example 16-24 <textproc.html#ROT13>`__ and `Example
    16-25 <textproc.html#CRYPTOQUOTE>`__ .



.. caution::

    The ``            $*           `` and ``            $@           ``
    parameters sometimes display inconsistent and puzzling behavior,
    depending on the setting of `$IFS <internalvariables.html#IFSREF>`__
    .

Exemple 8. ``$*`` and ``$@`` when ``$IFS`` is empty
===================================================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash

        #  If $IFS set, but empty,
        #+ then "$*" and "$@" do not echo positional params as expected.

        mecho ()       # Echo positional parameters.
        {
        echo "$1,$2,$3";
        }


        IFS=""         # Set, but empty.
        set a b c      # Positional parameters.

        mecho "$*"     # abc,,
        #                   ^^
        mecho $*       # a,b,c

        mecho $@       # a,b,c
        mecho "$@"     # a,b,c

        #  The behavior of $* and $@ when $IFS is empty depends
        #+ on which Bash or sh version being run.
        #  It is therefore inadvisable to depend on this "feature" in a script.


        # Thanks, Stephane Chazelas.

        exit






**Other Special Parameters**

 ``$-``
=======

    Flags passed to script (using `set <internal.html#SETREF>`__ ). See
    `Example 15-16 <internal.html#EX34>`__ .



.. caution::

    This was originally a *ksh* construct adopted into Bash, and
    unfortunately it does not seem to work reliably in Bash scripts. One
    possible use for it is to have a script `self-test whether it is
    interactive <intandnonint.html#IITEST>`__ .




``$!``
======

    `PID <special-chars.html#PROCESSIDDEF>`__ (process ID) of last job
    run in background


    .. code-block:: sh

        LOG=$0.log

        COMMAND1="sleep 100"

        echo "Logging PIDs background commands for script: $0" >> "$LOG"
        # So they can be monitored, and killed as necessary.
        echo >> "$LOG"

        # Logging commands.

        echo -n "PID of \"$COMMAND1\":  " >> "$LOG"
        ${COMMAND1} &
        echo $! >> "$LOG"
        # PID of "sleep 100":  1506

        # Thank you, Jacques Lederer, for suggesting this.



    Using ``         $!        `` for job control:


    .. code-block:: sh

        possibly_hanging_job & { sleep ${TIMEOUT}; eval 'kill -9 $!' &> /dev/null; }
        # Forces completion of an ill-behaved program.
        # Useful, for example, in init scripts.

        # Thank you, Sylvain Fourmanoit, for this creative use of the "!" variable.



    Or, alternately:


    .. code-block:: sh

        # This example by Matthew Sage.
        # Used with permission.

        TIMEOUT=30   # Timeout value in seconds
        count=0

        possibly_hanging_job & {
                while ((count < TIMEOUT )); do
                        eval '[ ! -d "/proc/$!" ] && ((count = TIMEOUT))'
                        # /proc is where information about running processes is found.
                        # "-d" tests whether it exists (whether directory exists).
                        # So, we're waiting for the job in question to show up.
                        ((count++))
                        sleep 1
                done
                eval '[ -d "/proc/$!" ] && kill -15 $!'
                # If the hanging job is running, kill it.
        }

        #  -------------------------------------------------------------- #

        #  However, this may not not work as specified if another process
        #+ begins to run after the "hanging_job" . . .
        #  In such a case, the wrong job may be killed.
        #  Ariel Meragelman suggests the following fix.

        TIMEOUT=30
        count=0
        # Timeout value in seconds
        possibly_hanging_job & {

        while ((count < TIMEOUT )); do
          eval '[ ! -d "/proc/$lastjob" ] && ((count = TIMEOUT))'
          lastjob=$!
          ((count++))
          sleep 1
        done
        eval '[ -d "/proc/$lastjob" ] && kill -15 $lastjob'

        }

        exit



``$_``
======

    Special variable set to final argument of previous command executed.


Exemple 9. Underscore variable
==============================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash

        echo $_              #  /bin/bash
                             #  Just called /bin/bash to run the script.
                             #  Note that this will vary according to
                             #+ how the script is invoked.

        du >/dev/null        #  So no output from command.
        echo $_              #  du

        ls -al >/dev/null    #  So no output from command.
        echo $_              #  -al  (last argument)

        :
        echo $_              #  :




``$?``
======

    `Exit status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`__ of a command,
    `function <functions.html#FUNCTIONREF>`__ , or the script itself
    (see `Example 24-7 <complexfunct.html#MAX>`__ )

``$$``
======

    Process ID ( *PID* ) of the script itself. ` [5]
     <internalvariables.html#FTN.AEN5654>`__ The ``         $$        ``
    variable often finds use in scripts to construct "unique" temp file
    names (see `Example 32-6 <debugging.html#ONLINE>`__ , `Example
    16-31 <filearchiv.html#DERPM>`__ , and `Example
    15-27 <x9644.html#SELFDESTRUCT>`__ ). This is usually simpler than
    invoking `mktemp <filearchiv.html#MKTEMPREF>`__ .


.. rubric:: Anotacions


` [1]  <internalvariables.html#AEN4671>`__

 A *stack register* is a set of consecutive memory locations, such that
the values stored ( *pushed* ) are retrieved ( *popped* ) in *reverse*
order. The last value stored is the first retrieved. This is sometimes
called a ``               LIFO             `` ( *last-in-first-out* ) or
*pushdown* stack.


` [2]  <internalvariables.html#AEN5154>`__

The PID of the currently running script is ``       $$      `` , of
course.


` [3]  <internalvariables.html#AEN5320>`__

Somewhat analogous to `recursion <localvar.html#RECURSIONREF>`__ , in
this context *nesting* refers to a pattern embedded within a larger
pattern. One of the definitions of *nest* , according to the 1913
edition of *Webster's Dictionary* , illustrates this beautifully: " *A
collection of boxes, cases, or the like, of graduated size, each put
within the one next larger.* "


` [4]  <internalvariables.html#AEN5479>`__

The words "argument" and "parameter" are often used interchangeably. In
the context of this document, they have the same precise meaning: *a
variable passed to a script or function.*


` [5]  <internalvariables.html#AEN5654>`__

Within a script, inside a subshell, ``       $$      `` `returns the PID
of the script <internalvariables.html#BASHPIDREF>`__ , not the subshell.
