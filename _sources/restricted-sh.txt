** Disabled commands in restricted shells**


    **.** Running a script or portion of a script in *restricted mode*
    disables certain commands that would otherwise be available. This is
    a security measure intended to limit the privileges of the script
    user and to minimize possible damage from running the script.



The following commands and actions are disabled:

-  Using ``                 cd               `` to change the working
   directory.

-  Changing the values of the ``                 $PATH               ``
   , ``                 $SHELL               `` ,
   ``                 $BASH_ENV               `` , or
   ``                 $ENV               `` `environmental
   variables <othertypesv.html#ENVREF>`__ .

-  Reading or changing the
   ``                 $SHELLOPTS               `` , shell environmental
   options.

-  Output redirection.

-  Invoking commands containing one or more / 's.

-  Invoking `exec <internal.html#EXECREF>`__ to substitute a different
   process for the shell.

-  Various other commands that would enable monkeying with or attempting
   to subvert the script for an unintended purpose.

-  Getting out of restricted mode within the script.


Exemple 1. Running a script in restricted mode
==============================================


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash

    #  Starting the script with "#!/bin/bash -r"
    #+ runs entire script in restricted mode.

    echo

    echo "Changing directory."
    cd /usr/local
    echo "Now in `pwd`"
    echo "Coming back home."
    cd
    echo "Now in `pwd`"
    echo

    # Everything up to here in normal, unrestricted mode.

    set -r
    # set --restricted    has same effect.
    echo "==> Now in restricted mode. <=="

    echo
    echo

    echo "Attempting directory change in restricted mode."
    cd ..
    echo "Still in `pwd`"

    echo
    echo

    echo "\$SHELL = $SHELL"
    echo "Attempting to change shell in restricted mode."
    SHELL="/bin/ash"

    echo
    echo

    echo "Attempting to redirect output in restricted mode."
