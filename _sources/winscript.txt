XXX  36.10. Shell Scripting Under Windows
#########################################

Even users running *that other* OS can run UNIX-like shell scripts, and
therefore benefit from many of the lessons of this book. The
`Cygwin <http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/>`__ package from Cygnus
and the `MKS utilities <http://www.mkssoftware.com/>`__ from Mortice
Kern Associates add shell scripting capabilities to Windows.

Another alternative is
`UWIN <http://www2.research.att.com/~gsf/download/uwin/uwin.html>`__ ,
written by David Korn of AT&T, of `Korn
Shell <biblio.html#KORNSHELLREF>`__ fame.

In 2006, Microsoft released the Windows Powershell Â®, which contains
limited Bash-like command-line scripting capabilities.
