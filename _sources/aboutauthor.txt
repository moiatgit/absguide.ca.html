Who is this guy anyhow?

The author claims no credentials or special qualifications,
`[1] <aboutauthor.html#FTN.AEN21292>`__ other than a compulsion to
write. `[2] <aboutauthor.html#FTN.AEN21295>`__

This book is somewhat of a departure from his other major work, `HOW-2
Meet Women: The Shy Man's Guide to
Relationships <http://bash.deta.in/hmw60.zip>`__. He has also written
the `Software-Building
HOWTO <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html>`__. Of late,
he has been trying his (heavy) hand at fiction: `Dave Dawson Over Berlin
(First
Installment) <http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.epub>`__ `Dave
Dawson Over Berlin (Second
Installment) <http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.II.epub>`__
and `Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Third
Installment) <http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.III.epub>`__ .
He also has a few *Instructables*
(`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Morse-Code-Shield/>`__,
`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Haywired-Hackduino/>`__,
`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-DIY-SD-Card-Logging-Shield/>`__,
`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Binguino-An-Arduino-based-Bingo-Number-Generato/>`__,
`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Lapdock-Connection/>`__,
`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Connection/>`__,
and
`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Switchable-Dual-Voltage-33v5v-Hacduino/>`__
to his (dis)credit.

A Linux user since 1995 (Slackware 2.2, kernel 1.2.1), the author has
emitted a few software truffles, including the
`cruft <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/cruft-0.2.tar.gz>`__
one-time pad encryption utility, the
`mcalc <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/mcalc-1.6.tar.gz>`__
mortgage calculator, the
`judge <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/games/amusements/judge-1.0.tar.gz>`__
ScrabbleÂ® adjudicator, the
`yawl <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/libs/yawl-0.3.2.tar.gz>`__ word
gaming list package, and the
`Quacky <http://bash.deta.in/qky.README.html>`__ anagramming gaming
package. He got off to a rather shaky start in the computer game --
programming FORTRAN IV on a CDC 3800 (on paper coding pads, with
occasional forays on a keypunch machine and a Friden Flexowriter) -- and
is not the least bit nostalgic for those days.

Living in an out-of-the-way community with wife and orange tabby, he
cherishes human frailty, especially his own.

In fact, he has no credentials or    
special qualifications. He's a       
school dropout with no formal        
credentials or professional          
experience whatsoever. None. Zero.   
Nada. Aside from the *ABS Guide*,    
his major claim to fame is a First   
Place in the sack race at the Colfax 
Elementary School Field Day in June, 
1958.
