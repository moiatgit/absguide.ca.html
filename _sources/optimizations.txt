XXX  36.6. Optimizations
########################

Most shell scripts are quick 'n dirty solutions to non-complex problems.
As such, optimizing them for speed is not much of an issue. Consider the
case, though, where a script carries out an important task, does it
well, but runs too slowly. Rewriting it in a compiled language may not
be a palatable option. The simplest fix would be to rewrite the parts of
the script that slow it down. Is it possible to apply principles of code
optimization even to a lowly shell script?

Check the loops in the script. Time consumed by repetitive operations
adds up quickly. If at all possible, remove time-consuming operations
from within loops.

Use `builtin <internal.html#BUILTINREF>`__ commands in preference to
system commands. Builtins execute faster and usually do not launch a
subshell when invoked.

Avoid unnecessary commands, particularly in a
`pipe <special-chars.html#PIPEREF>`__ .


.. code-block:: sh

    cat "$file"grep "$word"

    grep "$word" "$file"

    #  The above command-lines have an identical effect,
    #+ but the second runs faster since it launches one fewer subprocess.



The `cat <basic.html#CATREF>`__ command seems especially prone to
overuse in scripts.



Disabling certain Bash options can speed up scripts.

As Erik Brandsberg points out:

If you don't need `Unicode <bashver4.html#UNICODEREF>`__ support, you
can get potentially a 2x or more improvement in speed by simply setting
the ``                   LC_ALL                 `` variable.


.. code-block:: sh

       export LC_ALL=C

       [specifies the locale as ANSI C,
       thereby disabling Unicode support]

    [In an example script ...]

    Without [Unicode support]:
    erik@erik-desktop:~/capture$ time ./cap-ngrep.sh
    live2.pcap > out.txt

      real        0m20.483s
      user        1m34.470s
      sys         0m12.869s

    With [Unicode support]:
    erik@erik-desktop:~/capture$ time ./cap-ngrep.sh
    live2.pcap > out.txt

      real        0m50.232s
      user        3m51.118s
      sys         0m11.221s

    A large part of the overhead that is optimized is, I believe,
    regex match using [[ string =~ REGEX ]],
    but it may help with other portions of the code as well.
    I hadn't [seen it] mentioned that this optimization helped
    with Bash, but I had seen it helped with "grep,"
    so why not try?

Certain operators, notably `expr <moreadv.html#EXPRREF>`__ , are very
inefficient and might be replaced by `double
parentheses <dblparens.html>`__ arithmetic expansion. See `Example
A-59 <contributed-scripts.html#TESTEXECTIME>`__ .

`Condition testing <tests.html#IFTHEN>`__ constructs in scripts deserve
close scrutiny. Substitute `case <testbranch.html#CASEESAC1>`__ for
`if-then <tests.html#IFTHEN>`__ constructs and combine tests when
possible, to minimize script execution time. Again, refer to `Example

|Note

Erik Brandsberg recommends using `associative
arrays <bashver4.html#ASSOCARR>`__ in preference to conventional
numeric-indexed arrays in most cases. When overwriting values in a
numeric array, there is a significant performance penalty vs.
associative arrays. Running a test script confirms this. See `Example
A-60 <contributed-scripts.html#ASSOCARRTEST>`__ .

Use the `time <timedate.html#TIMREF>`__ and
`times <x9644.html#TIMESREF>`__ tools to profile computation-intensive
commands. Consider rewriting time-critical code sections in C, or even
in assembler.

Try to minimize file I/O. Bash is not particularly efficient at handling
files, so consider using more appropriate tools for this within the
script, such as `awk <awk.html#AWKREF>`__ or
`Perl <wrapper.html#PERLREF>`__ .

Write your scripts in a modular and coherent form, ` [1]
 <optimizations.html#FTN.AEN20452>`__ so they can be reorganized and
tightened up as necessary. Some of the optimization techniques
applicable to high-level languages may work for scripts, but others,
such as *loop unrolling* , are mostly irrelevant. Above all, use common
sense.

For an excellent demonstration of how optimization can dramatically
reduce the execution time of a script, see `Example
16-47 <mathc.html#MONTHLYPMT>`__ .


Notes
~~~~~


` [1]  <optimizations.html#AEN20452>`__

This usually means liberal use of
`functions <functions.html#FUNCTIONREF>`__ .
