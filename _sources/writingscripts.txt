XXX  O.2. Writing Scripts
#########################

Write a script to carry out each of the following tasks.


** EASY**

 **Self-reproducing Script**
    Write a script that backs itself up, that is, copies itself to a
    file named ``         backup.sh        `` .

    Hint: Use the `cat <basic.html#CATREF>`__ command and the
    appropriate `positional parameter <othertypesv.html#SCRNAMEPARAM>`__
    .

 **Home Directory Listing**
    Perform a recursive directory listing on the user's home directory
    and save the information to a file. Compress the file, have the
    script prompt the user to insert a USB flash drive, then press
    **ENTER** . Finally, save the file to the flash drive after making
    certain the flash drive has properly mounted by parsing the output
    of `df <system.html#DFREF>`__ . Note that the flash drive must be
    *unmounted* before it is removed.

 **Converting `for <loops1.html#FORLOOPREF1>`__ loops to
`while <loops1.html#WHILELOOPREF>`__ and
`until <loops1.html#UNTILLOOPREF>`__ loops**
    Convert the *for loops* in `Example 11-1 <loops1.html#EX22>`__ to
    *while loops* . Hint: store the data in an
    `array <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ and step through the array
    elements.

    Having already done the "heavy lifting," now convert the loops in
    the example to *until loops* .

 **Changing the line spacing of a text file**
    Write a script that reads each line of a target file, then writes
    the line back to ``         stdout        `` , but with an extra
    blank line following. This has the effect of *double-spacing* the
    file.

    Include all necessary code to check whether the script gets the
    necessary command-line argument (a filename), and whether the
    specified file exists.

    When the script runs correctly, modify it to *triple-space* the
    target file.

    Finally, write a script to remove all blank lines from the target
    file, *single-spacing* it.

 **Backwards Listing**
    Write a script that echoes itself to ``         stdout        `` ,
    but *backwards* .

 **Automatically Decompressing Files**
    Given a list of filenames as input, this script queries each target
    file (parsing the output of the `file <filearchiv.html#FILEREF>`__
    command) for the type of compression used on it. Then the script
    automatically invokes the appropriate decompression command (
    **gunzip** , **bunzip2** , **unzip** , **uncompress** , or
    whatever). If a target file is not compressed, the script emits a
    warning message, but takes no other action on that particular file.

 **Unique System ID**
    Generate a "unique" 6-digit hexadecimal identifier for your
    computer. Do *not* use the flawed `hostid <system.html#HOSTIDREF>`__
    command. Hint: **`md5sum <filearchiv.html#MD5SUMREF>`__
    ``           /etc/passwd          `` <files.html#DATAFILESREF1>`__**
    , then select the first 6 digits of output.

 **Backup**
    Archive as a "tarball" ( ``         *.tar.gz        `` file) all the
    files in your home directory tree (
    ``         /home/your-name        `` ) that have been modified in
    the last 24 hours. Hint: use `find <moreadv.html#FINDREF>`__ .

    Optional: you may use this as the basis of a *backup* script.

 **Checking whether a process is still running**
    Given a `process ID <special-chars.html#PROCESSIDREF>`__ ( *PID* )
    as an argument, this script will check, at user-specified intervals,
    whether the given process is still running. You may use the
    `ps <system.html#PPSSREF>`__ and `sleep <timedate.html#SLEEPREF>`__
    commands.

 **Primes**
    Print (to ``         stdout        `` ) all prime numbers between
    60000 and 63000. The output should be nicely formatted in columns
    (hint: use `printf <internal.html#PRINTFREF>`__ ).

 **Lottery Numbers**
    One type of lottery involves picking five different numbers, in the
    range of 1 - 50. Write a script that generates five pseudorandom
    numbers in this range, *with no duplicates* . The script will give
    the option of echoing the numbers to ``         stdout        `` or
    saving them to a file, along with the date and time the particular
    number set was generated. (If your script consistently generates
    *winning* lottery numbers, then you can retire on the proceeds and
    leave shell scripting to those of us who have to work for a living.)



** INTERMEDIATE**

 **Integer or String**
    Write a script `function <functions.html#FUNCTIONREF>`__ that
    determines if an argument passed to it is an integer or a string.
    The function will return TRUE (0) if passed an integer, and FALSE
    (1) if passed a string.

    Hint: What does the following expression return when
    ``         $1        `` is *not* an integer?

    ``         expr $1 + 0        ``

 **`ASCII <special-chars.html#ASCIIDEF>`__ to Integer**
    The *atoi* function in **C** converts a string character to an
    integer. Write a shell script function that performs the same
    operation. Likewise, write a shell script function that does the
    inverse, mirroring the **C** *itoa* function which converts an
    integer into an ASCII character.

 **Managing Disk Space**
    List, one at a time, all files larger than 100K in the
    ``         /home/username        `` directory tree. Give the user
    the option to delete or compress the file, then proceed to show the
    next one. Write to a logfile the names of all deleted files and the
    deletion times.

 **Banner**
    Simulate the functionality of the deprecated
    `banner <extmisc.html#BANNERREF>`__ command in a script.

 **Removing Inactive Accounts**
    Inactive accounts on a network server waste disk space and may
    become a security risk. Write an administrative script (to be
    invoked by *root* or the `cron daemon <system.html#CRONREF>`__ )
    that checks for and deletes user accounts that have not been
    accessed within the last 90 days.

 **Enforcing Disk Quotas**
    Write a script for a multi-user system that checks users' disk
    usage. If a user surpasses a preset limit (500 MB, for example) in
    her ``         /home/username        `` directory, then the script
    automatically sends her a "pigout" warning e-mail.

    The script will use the `du <system.html#DUREF>`__ and
    `mail <communications.html#COMMMAIL1>`__ commands. As an option, it
    will allow setting and enforcing quotas using the
    `quota <system.html#QUOTAREF>`__ and
    `setquota <system.html#SETQUOTAREF>`__ commands.

 **Logged in User Information**
    For all logged in users, show their real names and the time and date
    of their last login.

    Hint: use `who <system.html#WHOREF>`__ ,
    `lastlog <system.html#LASTLOGREF>`__ , and parse
    ``          /etc/passwd         `` <files.html#DATAFILESREF1>`__ .

 **Safe Delete**
    Implement, as a script, a "safe" delete command,
    ``         sdel.sh        `` . Filenames passed as command-line
    arguments to this script are not deleted, but instead
    `gzipped <filearchiv.html#GZIPREF>`__ if not already compressed (use
    `file <filearchiv.html#FILEREF>`__ to check), then moved to a
    ``         ~/TRASH        `` directory. Upon invocation, the script
    checks the ``         ~/TRASH        `` directory for files older
    than 48 hours and `permanently deletes <basic.html#RMREF>`__ them.
    (An better alternative might be to have a second script handle this,
    periodically invoked by the `cron daemon <system.html#CRONREF>`__ .)

    *Extra credit:* Write the script so it can handle files and
    directories `recursively <basic.html#RMRECURS>`__ . This would give
    it the capability of "safely deleting" entire directory structures.

 **Making Change**
    What is the most efficient way to make change for $1.68, using only
    coins in common circulations (up to 25c)? It's 6 quarters, 1 dime, a
    nickel, and three cents.

    Given any arbitrary command-line input in dollars and cents
    ($\*.??), calculate the change, using the minimum number of coins.
    If your home country is not the United States, you may use your
    local currency units instead. The script will need to parse the
    command-line input, then change it to multiples of the smallest
    monetary unit (cents or whatever). Hint: look at `Example
    24-8 <complexfunct.html#EX61>`__ .

 **Quadratic Equations**
    Solve a *quadratic* equation of the form
    ``                   Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0                 `` . Have a
    script take as arguments the coefficients,
    ``                   A                 `` ,
    ``                   B                 `` , and
    ``                   C                 `` , and return the solutions
    to five decimal places.

    Hint: pipe the coefficients to `bc <mathc.html#BCREF>`__ , using the
    well-known formula,
    ``                   x = ( -B +/- sqrt( B^2 - 4AC ) ) / 2A                 ``
    .

 **Table of Logarithms**
    Using the `bc <mathc.html#BCREF>`__ and
    `printf <internal.html#PRINTFREF>`__ commands, print out a
    nicely-formatted table of eight-place natural logarithms in the
    interval between 0.00 and 100.00, in steps of .01.

    Hint: *bc* requires the ``         -l        `` option to load the
    math library.

 **Unicode Table**
    Using `Example T-1 <asciitable.html#ASCIISH>`__ as a template, write
    a script that prints to a file a complete
    `Unicode <bashver4.html#UNICODEREF>`__ table.

    Hint: Use the ``         -e        `` option to
    `echo <internal.html#ECHOREF>`__ : **echo -e '\\uXXXX'** , where
    ``                   XXXX                 `` is the Unicode
    numerical character designation. This requires `version
    4.2 <bashver4.html#BASH42>`__ or later of Bash.

 **Sum of Matching Numbers**
    Find the sum of all five-digit numbers (in the range 10000 - 99999)
    containing *exactly two* out of the following set of digits: { 4, 5,
    6 }. These may repeat within the same number, and if so, they count
    once for each occurrence.

    Some examples of *matching numbers* are 42057, 74638, and 89515.

 **Lucky Numbers**
    A *lucky number* is one whose individual digits add up to 7, in
    successive additions. For example, 62431 is a *lucky number* (6 + 2
    + 4 + 3 + 1 = 16, 1 + 6 = 7). Find all the *lucky numbers* between
    1000 and 10000.

 **Craps**
    Borrowing the ASCII graphics from `Example
    A-40 <contributed-scripts.html#PETALS>`__ , write a script that
    plays the well-known gambling game of *craps* . The script will
    accept bets from one or more players, roll the dice, and keep track
    of wins and losses, as well as of each player's bankroll.

 **Tic-tac-toe**
    Write a script that plays the child's game of *tic-tac-toe* against
    a human player. The script will let the human choose whether to take
    the first move. The script will follow an optimal strategy, and
    therefore never lose. To simplify matters, you may use ASCII
    graphics:


    .. code-block:: sh

           ox
x
o

           Your move, human (row, column)?



 **Alphabetizing a String**
    Alphabetize (in ASCII order) an arbitrary string read from the
    command-line.

 **Parsing**
    Parse
    ``          /etc/passwd         `` <files.html#DATAFILESREF1>`__ ,
    and output its contents in nice, easy-to-read tabular form.

 **Logging Logins**
    Parse ``         /var/log/messages        `` to produce a nicely
    formatted file of user logins and login times. The script may need
    to run as *root* . (Hint: Search for the string "LOGIN." )

 **Pretty-Printing a Data File**
    Certain database and spreadsheet packages use save-files with the
    fields separated by commas, commonly referred to as *comma-separated
    values* or CSVs. Other applications often need to parse these files.

    Given a data file with comma-separated
    `fields <special-chars.html#FIELDREF>`__ , of the form:


    .. code-block:: sh

        Jones,Bill,235 S. Williams St.,Denver,CO,80221,(303) 244-7989
        Smith,Tom,404 Polk Ave.,Los Angeles,CA,90003,(213) 879-5612
        ...



    Reformat the data and print it out to ``        stdout       `` in
    labeled, evenly-spaced columns.

 **Justification**
    Given ASCII text input either from ``         stdin        `` or a
    file, adjust the word spacing to right-justify each line to a
    user-specified line-width, then send the output to
    ``         stdout        `` .

 **Mailing List**
    Using the `mail <communications.html#COMMMAIL1>`__ command, write a
    script that manages a simple mailing list. The script automatically
    e-mails the monthly company newsletter, read from a specified text
    file, and sends it to all the addresses on the mailing list, which
    the script reads from another specified file.

 **Generating Passwords**
    Generate pseudorandom 8-character passwords, using characters in the
    ranges [0-9], [A-Z], [a-z]. Each password must contain at least two
    digits.

 **Monitoring a User**
    You suspect that one particular user on the network has been abusing
    her privileges and possibly attempting to hack the system. Write a
    script to automatically monitor and log her activities when she's
    signed on. The log file will save entries for the previous week, and
    delete those entries more than seven days old.

    You may use `last <system.html#LASTREF>`__ ,
    `lastlog <system.html#LASTLOGREF>`__ , and
    `lastcomm <system.html#LASTCOMMREF>`__ to aid your surveillance of
    the suspected fiend.

 **Checking for Broken Links**
    Using `lynx <communications.html#LYNXREF>`__ with the
    ``         -traversal        `` option, write a script that checks a
    Web site for broken links.



** DIFFICULT**

 **Testing Passwords**
    Write a script to check and validate passwords. The object is to
    flag "weak" or easily guessed password candidates.

    A trial password will be input to the script as a command-line
    parameter. To be considered acceptable, a password must meet the
    following minimum qualifications:

    -  Minimum length of 8 characters

    -  Must contain at least one numeric character

    -  Must contain at least one of the following non-alphabetic
       characters: @ , # , $ , % , & , \* , + , - , =

    Optional:

    -  Do a dictionary check on every sequence of at least four
       consecutive alphabetic characters in the password under test.
       This will eliminate passwords containing embedded "words" found
       in a standard dictionary.

    -  Enable the script to check all the passwords on your system.
       These do not reside in
       ``            /etc/passwd           `` <files.html#DATAFILESREF1>`__
       .

    This exercise tests mastery of `Regular
    Expressions <regexp.html#REGEXREF>`__ .

 **Cross Reference**
    Write a script that generates a *cross-reference* ( *concordance* )
    on a target file. The output will be a listing of all word
    occurrences in the target file, along with the line numbers in which
    each word occurs. Traditionally, *linked list* constructs would be
    used in such applications. Therefore, you should investigate
    `arrays <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ in the course of this exercise.
    `Example 16-12 <textproc.html#WF>`__ is probably *not* a good place
    to start.

 **Square Root**
    Write a script to calculate square roots of numbers using *Newton's
    Method* .

    The algorithm for this, expressed as a snippet of Bash
    `pseudo-code <assortedtips.html#PSEUDOCODEREF>`__ is:


    .. code-block:: sh

        #  (Isaac) Newton's Method for speedy extraction
        #+ of square roots.

        guess = $argument
        #  $argument is the number to find the square root of.
        #  $guess is each successive calculated "guess" -- or trial solution --
        #+ of the square root.
        #  Our first "guess" at a square root is the argument itself.

        oldguess = 0
        # $oldguess is the previous $guess.

        tolerance = .000001
        # To how close a tolerance we wish to calculate.

        loopcnt = 0
        # Let's keep track of how many times through the loop.
        # Some arguments will require more loop iterations than others.


        while [ ABS( $guess $oldguess ) -gt $tolerance ]
        #       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Fix up syntax, of course.

        #      "ABS" is a (floating point) function to find the absolute value
        #+      of the difference between the two terms.
        #             So, as long as difference between current and previous
        #+            trial solution (guess) exceeds the tolerance, keep looping.

        do
           oldguess = $guess  # Update $oldguess to previous $guess.

        #  =======================================================
           guess = ( $oldguess + ( $argument / $oldguess ) ) / 2.0
        #        = 1/2 ( ($oldguess **2 + $argument) / $oldguess )
        #  equivalent to:
        #        = 1/2 ( $oldguess + $argument / $oldguess )
        #  that is, "averaging out" the trial solution and
        #+ the proportion of argument deviation
        #+ (in effect, splitting the error in half).
        #  This converges on an accurate solution
        #+ with surprisingly few loop iterations . . .
        #+ for arguments > $tolerance, of course.
        #  =======================================================

           (( loopcnt++ ))     # Update loop counter.
        done



    It's a simple enough recipe, and *seems* at first glance easy enough
    to convert into a working Bash script. The problem, though, is that
    Bash has `no native support for floating point
    numbers <ops.html#NOFLOATINGPOINT>`__ . So, the script writer needs
    to use `bc <mathc.html#BCREF>`__ or possibly
    `awk <awk.html#AWKREF>`__ to convert the numbers and do the
    calculations. It could get rather messy . . .

 **Logging File Accesses**
    Log all accesses to the files in ``         /etc        `` during
    the course of a single day. This information should include the
    filename, user name, and access time. If any alterations to the
    files take place, that will be flagged. Write this data as tabular
    (tab-separated) formatted records in a logfile.

 **Monitoring Processes**
    Write a script to continually monitor all running processes and to
    keep track of how many child processes each parent spawns. If a
    process spawns more than five children, then the script sends an
    e-mail to the system administrator (or *root* ) with all relevant
    information, including the time, PID of the parent, PIDs of the
    children, etc. The script appends a report to a log file every ten
    minutes.

 **Strip Comments**
    Strip all comments from a shell script whose name is specified on
    the command-line. Note that the initial `#!
    line <sha-bang.html#SHABANGREF>`__ must not be stripped out.

 **Strip HTML Tags**
    Strip all the HTML tags from a specified HTML file, then reformat it
    into lines between 60 and 75 characters in length. Reset paragraph
    and block spacing, as appropriate, and convert HTML tables to their
    approximate text equivalent.

 **XML Conversion**
    Convert an XML file to both HTML and text format.

    Optional: A script that converts Docbook/SGML to XML.

 **Chasing Spammers**
    Write a script that analyzes a spam e-mail by doing DNS lookups on
    the IP addresses in the headers to identify the relay hosts as well
    as the originating ISP. The script will forward the unaltered spam
    message to the responsible ISPs. Of course, it will be necessary to
    filter out *your own ISP's IP address* , so you don't end up
    complaining about yourself.

    As necessary, use the appropriate `network analysis
    commands <communications.html#COMMUNINFO1>`__ .

    For some ideas, see `Example
    16-41 <communications.html#ISSPAMMER>`__ and `Example
    A-28 <contributed-scripts.html#ISSPAMMER2>`__ .

    Optional: Write a script that searches through a list of e-mail
    messages and deletes the spam according to specified filters.

 **Creating man pages**
    Write a script that automates the process of creating `man
    pages <basic.html#MANREF>`__ .

    Given a text file which contains information to be formatted into a
    *man page* , the script will read the file, then invoke the
    appropriate `groff <textproc.html#GROFFREF>`__ commands to output
    the corresponding *man page* to ``         stdout        `` . The
    text file contains blocks of information under the standard *man
    page* headings, i.e., NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, etc.

    `Example A-39 <contributed-scripts.html#MANED>`__ is an instructive
    first step.

 **Hex Dump**
    Do a hex(adecimal) dump on a binary file specified as an argument to
    the script. The output should be in neat tabular
    `fields <special-chars.html#FIELDREF>`__ , with the first field
    showing the address, each of the next 8 fields a 4-byte hex number,
    and the final field the ASCII equivalent of the previous 8 fields.

    The obvious followup to this is to extend the hex dump script into a
    disassembler. Using a lookup table, or some other clever gimmick,
    convert the hex values into 80x86 op codes.

 **Emulating a Shift Register**
    Using `Example 27-15 <arrays.html#STACKEX>`__ as an inspiration,
    write a script that emulates a 64-bit shift register as an
    `array <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ . Implement functions to *load* the
    register, *shift left* , *shift right* , and *rotate* it. Finally,
    write a function that interprets the register contents as eight
    8-bit ASCII characters.

 **Calculating Determinants**
    Write a script that calculates determinants ` [1]
     <writingscripts.html#FTN.AEN25254>`__ by
    `recursively <localvar.html#RECURSIONREF0>`__ expanding the *minors*
    . Use a 4 x 4 determinant as a test case.

 **Hidden Words**
    Write a "word-find" puzzle generator, a script that hides 10 input
    words in a 10 x 10 array of random letters. The words may be hidden
    across, down, or diagonally.

    Optional: Write a script that *solves* word-find puzzles. To keep
    this from becoming too difficult, the solution script will find only
    horizontal and vertical words. (Hint: Treat each row and column as a
    string, and search for substrings.)

 **Anagramming**
    Anagram 4-letter input. For example, the anagrams of *word* are: *do
    or rod row word* . You may use
    ``         /usr/share/dict/linux.words        `` as the reference
    list.

 **Word Ladders**
    A "word ladder" is a sequence of words, with each successive word in
    the sequence differing from the previous one by a single letter.

    For example, to "ladder" from *mark* to *vase* :


    .. code-block:: sh

        mark --> park --> part --> past --> vast --> vase
                 ^           ^       ^      ^           ^



    Write a script that solves word ladder puzzles. Given a starting and
    an ending word, the script will list all intermediate steps in the
    "ladder." Note that *all* words in the sequence must be legitimate
    dictionary words.

 **Fog Index**
    The "fog index" of a passage of text estimates its reading
    difficulty, as a number corresponding roughly to a school grade
    level. For example, a passage with a fog index of 12 should be
    comprehensible to anyone with 12 years of schooling.

    The Gunning version of the fog index uses the following algorithm.

    #. Choose a section of the text at least 100 words in length.

    #. Count the number of sentences (a portion of a sentence truncated
       by the boundary of the text section counts as one).

    #. Find the average number of words per sentence.

       AVE\_WDS\_SEN = TOTAL\_WORDS / SENTENCES

    #. Count the number of "difficult" words in the segment -- those
       containing at least 3 syllables. Divide this quantity by total
       words to get the proportion of difficult words.

       PRO\_DIFF\_WORDS = LONG\_WORDS / TOTAL\_WORDS

    #. The Gunning fog index is the sum of the above two quantities,
       multiplied by 0.4, then rounded to the nearest integer.

       G\_FOG\_INDEX = int ( 0.4 \* ( AVE\_WDS\_SEN + PRO\_DIFF\_WORDS )
       )

    Step 4 is by far the most difficult portion of the exercise. There
    exist various algorithms for estimating the syllable count of a
    word. A rule-of-thumb formula might consider the number of letters
    in a word and the vowel-consonant mix.

    A strict interpretation of the Gunning fog index does not count
    compound words and proper nouns as "difficult" words, but this would
    enormously complicate the script.

 **Calculating PI using Buffon's Needle**
    The Eighteenth Century French mathematician de Buffon came up with a
    novel experiment. Repeatedly drop a needle of length
    ``                   n                 `` onto a wooden floor
    composed of long and narrow parallel boards. The cracks separating
    the equal-width floorboards are a fixed distance
    ``                   d                 `` apart. Keep track of the
    total drops and the number of times the needle intersects a crack on
    the floor. The ratio of these two quantities turns out to be a
    fractional multiple of PI.

    In the spirit of `Example 16-50 <mathc.html#CANNON>`__ , write a
    script that runs a Monte Carlo simulation of *Buffon's Needle* . To
    simplify matters, set the needle length equal to the distance
    between the cracks, ``                   n = d                 `` .

    Hint: there are actually two critical variables: the distance from
    the center of the needle to the nearest crack, and the inclination
    angle of the needle to that crack. You may use
    `bc <mathc.html#BCREF>`__ to handle the calculations.

 **Playfair Cipher**
    Implement the Playfair (Wheatstone) Cipher in a script.

    The Playfair Cipher encrypts text by substitution of *digrams*
    (2-letter groupings). It is traditional to use a 5 x 5 letter
    scrambled-alphabet *key square* for the encryption and decryption.


    .. code-block:: sh

           C O D E S
           A B F G H
           I K L M N
           P Q R T U
           V W X Y Z

        Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except "I" also represents
        "J". The arbitrarily chosen key word, "CODES" comes first, then all
        the rest of the alphabet, in order from left to right, skipping letters
        already used.

        To encrypt, separate the plaintext message into digrams (2-letter
        groups). If a group has two identical letters, delete the second, and
        form a new group. If there is a single letter left over at the end,
        insert a "null" character, typically an "X."

        THIS IS A TOP SECRET MESSAGE

        TH IS IS AT OP SE CR ET ME SA GE



        For each digram, there are three possibilities.
        -----------------------------------------------

        1) Both letters will be on the same row of the key square:
           For each letter, substitute the one immediately to the right, in that
           row. If necessary, wrap around left to the beginning of the row.

        or

        2) Both letters will be in the same column of the key square:
           For each letter, substitute the one immediately below it, in that
           row. If necessary, wrap around to the top of the column.

        or

        3) Both letters will form the corners of a rectangle within the key square:
           For each letter, substitute the one on the other corner the rectangle
           which lies on the same row.


        The "TH" digram falls under case #3.
        G H
        M N
        T U           (Rectangle with "T" and "H" at corners)

        T --> U
        H --> G


        The "SE" digram falls under case #1.
        C O D E S     (Row containing "S" and "E")

        S --> C  (wraps around left to beginning of row)
        E --> S

        =========================================================================

        To decrypt encrypted text, reverse the above procedure under cases #1
        and #2 (move in opposite direction for substitution). Under case #3,
        just take the remaining two corners of the rectangle.


        Helen Fouche Gaines' classic work, ELEMENTARY CRYPTANALYSIS (1939), gives a
        fairly detailed description of the Playfair Cipher and its solution methods.



    This script will have three main sections

    #. Generating the *key square* , based on a user-input keyword.

    #. Encrypting a *plaintext* message.

    #. Decrypting encrypted text.

    The script will make extensive use of
    `arrays <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ and
    `functions <functions.html#FUNCTIONREF>`__ . You may use `Example
    A-56 <contributed-scripts.html#GRONSFELD>`__ as an inspiration.

Notes
~~~~~


` [1]  <writingscripts.html#AEN25254>`__

For all you clever types who failed intermediate algebra, a
*determinant* is a numerical value associated with a multidimensional
*matrix* ( `array <arrays.html#ARRAYREF>`__ of numbers).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    For the simple case
of a 2 x 2 determinant:

      |a  b|
      |b  a|

    The solution is a*a
- b*b, where "a" and "b"
 represent numbers.
