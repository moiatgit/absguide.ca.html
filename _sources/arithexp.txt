XXX  Chapter 13. Arithmetic Expansion
#####################################

 Arithmetic expansion provides a powerful tool for performing (integer)
arithmetic operations in scripts. Translating a string into a numerical
expression is relatively straightforward using *backticks* , *double
parentheses* , or *let* .


** Variations**

 Arithmetic expansion with `backticks <commandsub.html#BACKQUOTESREF>`__
(often used in conjunction with `expr <moreadv.html#EXPRREF>`__ )


    .. code-block:: sh

        z=`expr $z + 3`          # The 'expr' command performs the expansion.



 Arithmetic expansion with `double parentheses <dblparens.html>`__ , and
using `let <internal.html#LETREF>`__
    The use of *backticks* ( *backquotes* ) in arithmetic expansion has
    been superseded by *double parentheses* --
    ``                   ((...))                 `` and
    ``                   $((...))                 `` -- and also by the
    very convenient `let <internal.html#LETREF>`__ construction.


    .. code-block:: sh

        z=$(($z+3))
        z=$((z+3))                                  #  Also correct.
                                                    #  Within double parentheses,
                                                    #+ parameter dereferencing
                                                    #+ is optional.

        # $((EXPRESSION)) is arithmetic expansion.  #  Not to be confused with
                                                    #+ command substitution.



        # You may also use operations within double parentheses without assignment.

          n=0
          echo "n = $n"                             # n = 0

          (( n += 1 ))                              # Increment.
        # (( $n += 1 )) is incorrect!
          echo "n = $n"                             # n = 1


        let z=z+3
        let "z += 3"  #  Quotes permit the use of spaces in variable assignment.
                      #  The 'let' operator actually performs arithmetic evaluation,
                      #+ rather than expansion.
