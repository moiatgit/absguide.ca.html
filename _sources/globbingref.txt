XXX 18.2. Globbing: expansi√≥ de noms de fitxer
##############################################

Bash itself cannot recognize Regular Expressions. Inside scripts, it is
commands and utilities -- such as `sed <sedawk.html#SEDREF>`__ and
`awk <awk.html#AWKREF>`__ -- that interpret RE's.

Bash *does* carry out *filename expansion* ` [1]
 <globbingref.html#FTN.AEN17572>`__ -- a process known as *globbing* --
but this does *not* use the standard RE set. Instead, globbing
recognizes and expands *wild cards* . Globbing interprets the standard
wild card characters ` [2]  <globbingref.html#FTN.AEN17581>`__ --
`\* <special-chars.html#ASTERISKREF>`__ and
`? <special-chars.html#WILDCARDQU>`__ , character lists in square
brackets, and certain other special characters (such as ^ for negating
the sense of a match). There are important limitations on wild card
characters in globbing, however. Strings containing
``             *           `` will not match filenames that start with a
dot, as, for example, ``       .bashrc      `` <sample-bashrc.html>`__
. ` [3]  <globbingref.html#FTN.AEN17592>`__ Likewise, the
``             ?           `` has a different meaning in globbing than
as part of an RE.

    bash$ ls -l t?.sh
    -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       466 Aug  6 17:48 t2.sh

    bash$ ls -l [ab]*
    -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 a.1
     -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 b.1

    bash$ ls -l [a-c]*
    -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 a.1
     -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 b.1
     -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 c.1

    bash$ ls -l [^ab]*
    -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 c.1
     -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       466 Aug  6 17:48 t2.sh
     -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       758 Jul 30 09:02 test1.txt

    bash$ ls -l {b*,c*,*est*}
    -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 b.1
     -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug  6 18:42 c.1
     -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       758 Jul 30 09:02 test1.txt




Bash performs filename expansion on unquoted command-line arguments. The
`echo <internal.html#ECHOREF>`__ command demonstrates this.


.. code-block:: sh

    bash$ echo *
    a.1 b.1 c.1 t2.sh test1.txt

    bash$ echo t*
    t2.sh test1.txt

    bash$ echo t?.sh
    t2.sh






Note

It is possible to modify the way Bash interprets special characters in
globbing. A **set -f** command disables globbing, and the
``         nocaseglob        `` and ``         nullglob        ``
options to `shopt <internal.html#SHOPTREF>`__ change globbing behavior.




See also `Example 11-5 <loops1.html#LISTGLOB>`__ .



Caution

 Filenames with embedded
`whitespace <special-chars.html#WHITESPACEREF>`__ can cause *globbing*
to choke. `David
Wheeler <http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html>`__
shows how to avoid many such pitfalls.

Notes
~~~~~


` [1]  <globbingref.html#AEN17572>`__

*Filename expansion* means expanding filename patterns or templates
containing special characters. For example, ``       example.???      ``
might expand to ``       example.001      `` and/or
``       example.txt      `` .


` [2]  <globbingref.html#AEN17581>`__

 A *wild card* character, analogous to a wild card in poker, can
represent (almost) any other character.


` [3]  <globbingref.html#AEN17592>`__

Filename expansion *can* match dotfiles, but only if the pattern
explicitly includes the dot as a literal character.
