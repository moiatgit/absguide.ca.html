  36.8.1. Infected Shell Scripts
-------------------------------

A brief warning about script security is indicated. A shell script may
contain a *worm* , *trojan* , or even a *virus* . For that reason, never
run as *root* a script (or permit it to be inserted into the system
startup scripts in ``       /etc/rc.d      `` ) unless you have obtained
said script from a trusted source or you have carefully analyzed it to
make certain it does nothing harmful.

Various researchers at Bell Labs and other sites, including M. Douglas
McIlroy, Tom Duff, and Fred Cohen have investigated the implications of
shell script viruses. They conclude that it is all too easy for even a
novice, a "script kiddie," to write one. ` [1]

Here is yet another reason to learn scripting. Being able to look at and
understand scripts may protect your system from being compromised by a
rogue script.



  36.8.2. Hiding Shell Script Source
-----------------------------------

For security purposes, it may be necessary to render a script
unreadable. If only there were a utility to create a stripped binary
executable from a script. Francisco Rosales' `shc -- generic shell
script compiler <http://www.datsi.fi.upm.es/~frosal/sources/>`__ does
exactly that.

Unfortunately, according to `an
article <http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8256>`__ in the October,
2005 *Linux Journal* , the binary can, in at least some cases, be
decrypted to recover the original script source. Still, this could be a
useful method of keeping scripts secure from all but the most skilled
hackers.



  36.8.3. Writing Secure Shell Scripts
-------------------------------------

*Dan Stromberg* suggests the following guidelines for writing
(relatively) secure shell scripts.

-  Don't put secret data in `environment
   variables <othertypesv.html#ENVREF>`__ .

-  Don't pass secret data in an external command's arguments (pass them
   in via a `pipe <special-chars.html#PIPEREF>`__ or
   `redirection <io-redirection.html#IOREDIRREF>`__ instead).

-  Set your `$PATH <internalvariables.html#PATHREF>`__ carefully. Don't
   just trust whatever path you inherit from the caller if your script
   is running as *root* . In fact, whenever you use an environment
   variable inherited from the caller, think about what could happen if
   the caller put something misleading in the variable, e.g., if the
   caller set `$HOME <internalvariables.html#HOMEDIRREF>`__ to
   ``         /etc        `` .
