XXX  Chapter 33. Options
########################

Options are settings that change shell and/or script behavior.

The `set <internal.html#SETREF>`__ command enables options within a
script. At the point in the script where you want the options to take
effect, use **set -o option-name** or, in short form, **set
-option-abbrev** . These two forms are equivalent.


.. code-block:: sh

          #!/bin/bash

          set -o verbose
          # Echoes all commands before executing.





.. code-block:: sh

          #!/bin/bash

          set -v
          # Exact same effect as above.






|Note

To *disable* an option within a script, use **set +o option-name** or
**set +option-abbrev** .





.. code-block:: sh

          #!/bin/bash

          set -o verbose
          # Command echoing on.
          command
          ...
          command

          set +o verbose
          # Command echoing off.
          command
          # Not echoed.


          set -v
          # Command echoing on.
          command
          ...
          command

          set +v
          # Command echoing off.
          command

          exit 0




An alternate method of enabling options in a script is to specify them
immediately following the ``             #!           `` script header.


.. code-block:: sh

          #!/bin/bash -x
          #
          # Body of script follows.




It is also possible to enable script options from the command line. Some
options that will not work with **set** are available this way. Among
these are ``             -i           `` , force script to run
interactive.

``             bash -v script-name           ``

``             bash -o verbose script-name           ``

The following is a listing of some useful options. They may be specified
in either abbreviated form (preceded by a single dash) or by complete
name (preceded by a *double* dash or by ``      -o     `` ).

``        -e       ``

errexit

Abort script at first error, when a command exits with non-zero status
(except in `until <loops1.html#UNTILLOOPREF>`__ or `while
loops <loops1.html#WHILELOOPREF>`__ ,
`if-tests <testconstructs.html#TESTCONSTRUCTS1>`__ , `list
constructs <list-cons.html#LCONS1>`__ )

noglob

Filename expansion (globbing) disabled

``        globstar       ``

`*globbing* star-match <bashver4.html#GLOBSTARREF>`__

Enables the \*\* `globbing <globbingref.html>`__ operator ( `version
4+ <bashver4.html#BASH4REF>`__ of Bash). *Usage:* shopt -s globstar

``        -i       ``

interactive

Script runs in *interactive* mode

``        -n       ``

noexec

``        -o Option-Name       ``

(none)

Invoke the *Option-Name* option

``        -o posix       ``

Change the behavior of Bash, or invoked script, to conform to
`POSIX <sha-bang.html#POSIX2REF>`__ standard.

``        -o pipefail       ``

pipe failure

Causes a pipeline to return the `exit
status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`__ of the last command in the

``        -p       ``

privileged

Script runs as "suid" (caution!)

``        -r       ``

22 <restricted-sh.html>`__ ).

``        -s       ``

stdin

Read commands from ``        stdin       ``

``        -t       ``

(none)

``        -       ``

(none)

``                 -- arg1 arg2               `` ), positional
