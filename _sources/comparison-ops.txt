XXX  7.3. Other Comparison Operators
####################################

Un operador de comparació binari, permet comparar dos valors.

Hi ha operadors de comparació diferents pels dos tipus de valors: strings i enters.


Comparació d'enters
===================

 -eq
    is equal to

    ``                   if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]                 ``

 -ne
    is not equal to

    ``                   if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]                 ``

 -gt
    is greater than

    ``                   if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]                 ``

 -ge
    is greater than or equal to

    ``                   if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]                 ``

 -lt
    is less than

    ``                   if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]                 ``

 -le
    is less than or equal to

    ``                   if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]                 ``

 <
    is less than (within `double parentheses <dblparens.html>`__ )

    ``                   (("$a" < "$b"))                 ``

 <=
    is less than or equal to (within double parentheses)

    ``                   (("$a" <= "$b"))                 ``

 >
    is greater than (within double parentheses)

    ``                   (("$a" > "$b"))                 ``

 >=
    is greater than or equal to (within double parentheses)

    ``                   (("$a" >= "$b"))                 ``


Comparació de strings
=====================

 =

    is equal to

    ``                   if [ "$a" = "$b" ]                 ``



.. caution::

    Note the `whitespace <special-chars.html#WHITESPACEREF>`__ framing
    the **=** .

    ``                         if [ "$a"="$b" ]                       ``
    is *not* equivalent to the above.




 ==
    is equal to

    ``                   if [ "$a" == "$b" ]                 ``

    This is a synonym for = .



.. note::

    The == comparison operator behaves differently within a
    `double-brackets <testconstructs.html#DBLBRACKETS>`__ test than
    within single brackets.

 
.. code-block:: sh

    [[ $a == z* ]]   # T
rue if $a starts with an
 "z" (pattern matching).
    [[ $a == "z*" ]] # T
rue if $a is equal to z*
 (literal matching).

    [ $a == z* ]     # F
ile globbing and word sp
litting take place.
    [ "$a" == "z*" ] # T
rue if $a is equal to z*
 (literal matching).

    # Thanks, StÃ©phane
Chazelas


    .. code-block:: sh

        [[ $a == z* ]]   # True if $a starts with an "z" (pattern matching).
        [[ $a == "z*" ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).

        [ $a == z* ]     # File globbing and word splitting take place.
        [ "$a" == "z*" ] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).

        # Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas


    .. code-block:: sh

        [[ $a == z* ]]   # True if $a starts with an "z" (pattern matching).
        [[ $a == "z*" ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).

        [ $a == z* ]     # File globbing and word splitting take place.
        [ "$a" == "z*" ] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).

        # Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas



.. _comparison-ops_notequalto:

 !=
    is not equal to

    ``                   if [ "$a" != "$b" ]                 ``

    This operator uses pattern matching within a `[[ ...
    ]] <testconstructs.html#DBLBRACKETS>`__ construct.

 <
    is less than, in `ASCII <special-chars.html#ASCIIDEF>`__
    alphabetical order

    ``                   if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]                 ``

    ``                   if [ "$a" \< "$b" ]                 ``

    Note that the "<" needs to be
    `escaped <escapingsection.html#ESCP>`__ within a
    ``                   [  ]                 `` construct.

 >
    is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order

    ``                   if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]                 ``

    ``                   if [ "$a" \> "$b" ]                 ``

    Note that the ">" needs to be escaped within a
    ``                   [  ]                 `` construct.

    See `Example 27-11 <arrays.html#BUBBLE>`__ for an application of
    this comparison operator.

 -z
    string is *null* , that is, has zero length


    .. code-block:: sh

         String=''   # Zero-length ("null") string variable.

        if [ -z "$String" ]
        then
          echo "\$String is null."
        else
          echo "\$String is NOT null."
        fi     # $String is null.



 -n
    string is not *null.*



.. caution::

    The ``                         -n                       `` test
    requires that the string be quoted within the test brackets. Using
    an unquoted string with *! -z* , or even just the unquoted string
    alone within test brackets (see `Example
    7-6 <comparison-ops.html#STRTEST>`__ ) normally works, however, this
    is an unsafe practice. *Always* quote a tested string. ` [1]
     <comparison-ops.html#FTN.AEN3669>`__






Exemple 5. Arithmetic and string comparisons
============================================


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash

    a=4
    b=5

    #  Here "a" and "b" can be treated either as integers or strings.
    #  There is some blurring between the arithmetic and string comparisons,
    #+ since Bash variables are not strongly typed.

    #  Bash permits integer operations and comparisons on variables
    #+ whose value consists of all-integer characters.
    #  Caution advised, however.

    echo

    if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]
    then
      echo "$a is not equal to $b"
      echo "(arithmetic comparison)"
    fi

    echo

    if [ "$a" != "$b" ]
    then
      echo "$a is not equal to $b."
      echo "(string comparison)"
      #     "4"  != "5"
      # ASCII 52 != ASCII 53
    fi

    # In this particular instance, both "-ne" and "!=" work.

    echo

    exit 0





Exemple 6. Testing whether a string is *null*
=============================================


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash
    #  str-test.sh: Testing null strings and unquoted strings,
    #+ but not strings and sealing wax, not to mention cabbages and kings . . .

    # Using   if [ ... ]

    # If a string has not been initialized, it has no defined value.
    # This state is called "null" (not the same as zero!).

    if [ -n $string1 ]    # string1 has not been declared or initialized.
    then
      echo "String \"string1\" is not null."
    else
      echo "String \"string1\" is null."
    fi                    # Wrong result.
    # Shows $string1 as not null, although it was not initialized.

    echo

    # Let's try it again.

    if [ -n "$string1" ]  # This time, $string1 is quoted.
    then
      echo "String \"string1\" is not null."
    else
      echo "String \"string1\" is null."
    fi                    # Quote strings within test brackets!

    echo

    if [ $string1 ]       # This time, $string1 stands naked.
    then
      echo "String \"string1\" is not null."
    else
      echo "String \"string1\" is null."
    fi                    # This works fine.
    # The [ ... ] test operator alone detects whether the string is null.
    # However it is good practice to quote it (if [ "$string1" ]).
    #
    # As Stephane Chazelas points out,
    #    if [ $string1 ]    has one argument, "]"
    #    if [ "$string1" ]  has two arguments, the empty "$string1" and "]"


    echo


    string1=initialized

    if [ $string1 ]       # Again, $string1 stands unquoted.
    then
      echo "String \"string1\" is not null."
    else
      echo "String \"string1\" is null."
    fi                    # Again, gives correct result.
    # Still, it is better to quote it ("$string1"), because . . .


    string1="a = b"

    if [ $string1 ]       # Again, $string1 stands unquoted.
    then
      echo "String \"string1\" is not null."
    else
      echo "String \"string1\" is null."
    fi                    # Not quoting "$string1" now gives wrong result!

    exit 0   # Thank you, also, Florian Wisser, for the "heads-up".





Exemple 7. *zmore*
==================


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash
    # zmore

    # View gzipped files with 'more' filter.

    E_NOARGS=85
    E_NOTFOUND=86
    E_NOTGZIP=87

    if [ $# -eq 0 ] # same effect as:  if [ -z "$1" ]
    # $1 can exist, but be empty:  zmore "" arg2 arg3
    then
      echo "Usage: `basename $0` filename" >&2
      # Error message to stderr.
      exit $E_NOARGS
      # Returns 85 as exit status of script (error code).
    fi

    filename=$1

    if [ ! -f "$filename" ]   # Quoting $filename allows for possible spaces.
    then
      echo "File $filename not found!" >&2   # Error message to stderr.
      exit $E_NOTFOUND
    fi

    if [ ${filename##*.} != "gz" ]
    # Using bracket in variable substitution.
    then
      echo "File $1 is not a gzipped file!"
      exit $E_NOTGZIP
    fi

    zcat $1more

    # Uses the 'more' filter.
    # May substitute 'less' if desired.

    exit $?   # Script returns exit status of pipe.
    #  Actually "exit $?" is unnecessary, as the script will, in any case,
    #+ return the exit status of the last command executed.





** compound comparison**

 -a
    logical and

    ``                   exp1 -a exp2                 `` returns true if
    *both* exp1 and exp2 are true.

 -o
    logical or

    ``                   exp1 -o exp2                 `` returns true if
    either exp1 *or* exp2 is true.


These are similar to the Bash comparison operators **&&** and **\|\|** ,
used within `double brackets <testconstructs.html#DBLBRACKETS>`__ .


.. code-block:: sh

    [[ condition1 && condition2 ]]



The **-o** and **-a** operators work with the
`test <testconstructs.html#TTESTREF>`__ command or occur within single
test brackets.


.. code-block:: sh

    if [ "$expr1" -a "$expr2" ]
    then
      echo "Both expr1 and expr2 are true."
    else
      echo "Either expr1 or expr2 is false."
    fi





|Caution

But, as *rihad* points out:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    [ 1 -eq 1 ] && [ -n
"`echo true 1>&2`" ]   #
 true
    [ 1 -eq 2 ] && [ -n
"`echo true 1>&2`" ]   #
 (no output)
    # ^^^^^^^ False cond
ition. So far, everythin
g as expected.

    # However ...
    [ 1 -eq 2 -a -n "`ec
ho true 1>&2`" ]       #
 true
    # ^^^^^^^ False cond
ition. So, why "true" ou
tput?

    # Is it because both
 condition clauses withi
n brackets evaluate?
    [[ 1 -eq 2 && -n "`e
cho true 1>&2`" ]]     #
 (no output)
    # No, that's not it.

    # Apparently && and
|| "short-circuit" while

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



.. code-block:: sh

    [ 1 -eq 1 ] && [ -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]   # true
    [ 1 -eq 2 ] && [ -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]   # (no output)
    # ^^^^^^^ False condition. So far, everything as expected.

    # However ...
    [ 1 -eq 2 -a -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]       # true
    # ^^^^^^^ False condition. So, why "true" output?

    # Is it because both condition clauses within brackets evaluate?
    [[ 1 -eq 2 && -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]]     # (no output)
    # No, that's not it.

    # Apparently && and |"short-circuit" while -a and -o do not.


.. code-block:: sh

    [ 1 -eq 1 ] && [ -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]   # true
    [ 1 -eq 2 ] && [ -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]   # (no output)
    # ^^^^^^^ False condition. So far, everything as expected.

    # However ...
    [ 1 -eq 2 -a -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]       # true

    # Is it because both condition clauses within brackets evaluate?
    [[ 1 -eq 2 && -n "`echo true 1>&2`" ]]     # (no output)
    # No, that's not it.

    # Apparently && and |"short-circuit" while -a and -o do not.

operators in action.


Notes
~~~~~


` [1]  <comparison-ops.html#AEN3669>`__

As S.C. points out, in a compound test, even quoting the string variable
might not suffice.
``               [ -n "$string" -o "$a" = "$b" ]             `` may
cause an error with some versions of Bash if ``       $string      `` is
empty. The safe way is to append an extra character to possibly empty
variables,
``               [ "x$string" != x -o "x$a" = "x$b" ]             ``
(the "x's" cancel out).
