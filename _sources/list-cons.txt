XXX  Chapter 26. List Constructs
################################

The *and list* and *or list* constructs provide a means of processing a
number of commands consecutively. These can effectively replace complex
nested `if/then <testconstructs.html#TESTCONSTRUCTS1>`__ or even
`case <testbranch.html#CASEESAC1>`__ statements.


** Chaining together commands**

 and list


    .. code-block:: sh

        command-1 && command-2 && command-3 && ... command-n



    Each command executes in turn, provided that the previous command
    has given a return value of ``                 true               ``
    (zero). At the first ``                 false               ``
    (non-zero) return, the command chain terminates (the first command
    returning ``                 false               `` is the last one
    to execute).

    An interesting use of a two-condition *and list* from an early
    version of YongYe's `Tetris game
    script <http://bash.deta.in/Tetris_Game.sh>`__ :


    .. code-block:: sh

        equation()

        {  # core algorithm used for doubling and halving the coordinates
           [[ ${cdx} ]] && ((y=cy+(ccy-cdy)${2}2))
           eval ${1}+=\"${x} ${y} \"
        }




Exemple 1. Using an *and list* to test for command-line arguments
=================================================================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # and list

        if [ ! -z "$1" ] && echo "Argument #1 = $1" && [ ! -z "$2" ] && \
        #                ^^                         ^^               ^^
        echo "Argument #2 = $2"
        then
          echo "At least 2 arguments passed to script."
          # All the chained commands return true.
        else
          echo "Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script."
          # At least one of the chained commands returns false.
        fi
        # Note that "if [ ! -z $1 ]" works, but its alleged equivalent,
        #   "if [ -n $1 ]" does not.
        #     However, quoting fixes this.
        #  if "[ -n "$1" ]" works.
        #           ^  ^    Careful!
        # It is always best to QUOTE the variables being tested.


        # This accomplishes the same thing, using "pure" if/then statements.
        if [ ! -z "$1" ]
        then
          echo "Argument #1 = $1"
        fi
        if [ ! -z "$2" ]
        then
          echo "Argument #2 = $2"
          echo "At least 2 arguments passed to script."
        else
          echo "Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script."
        fi
        # It's longer and more ponderous than using an "and list".


        exit $?





Exemple 2. Another command-line arg test using an *and list*
============================================================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash

        ARGS=1        # Number of arguments expected.
        E_BADARGS=85  # Exit value if incorrect number of args passed.

        test $# -ne $ARGS && \
        #    ^^^^^^^^^^^^ condition #1
        echo "Usage: `basename $0` $ARGS argument(s)" && exit $E_BADARGS
        #                                             ^^
        #  If condition #1 tests true (wrong number of args passed to script),
        #+ then the rest of the line executes, and script terminates.

        # Line below executes only if the above test fails.
        echo "Correct number of arguments passed to this script."

        exit 0

        # To check exit value, do a "echo $?" after script termination.




    Of course, an *and list* can also *set* variables to a default
    value.


    .. code-block:: sh

        arg1=$@ && [ -z "$arg1" ] && arg1=DEFAULT

                      # Set $arg1 to command-line arguments, if any.
                      # But . . . set to DEFAULT if not specified on command-line.



 or list


    .. code-block:: sh

        command-1 |command-2 || command-3 || ... command-n



    Each command executes in turn for as long as the previous command
    returns false . At the first true return, the command chain
    terminates (the first command returning true is the last one to
    execute). This is obviously the inverse of the "and list" .


Exemple 3. Using *or lists* in combination with an *and list*
=============================================================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash

        #  delete.sh, a not-so-cunning file deletion utility.
        #  Usage: delete filename

        E_BADARGS=85

        if [ -z "$1" ]
        then
          echo "Usage: `basename $0` filename"
          exit $E_BADARGS  # No arg? Bail out.
        else
          file=$1          # Set filename.
        fi


        [ ! -f "$file" ] && echo "File \"$file\" not found. \
        Cowardly refusing to delete a nonexistent file."
        # AND LIST, to give error message if file not present.
        # Note echo message continuing on to a second line after an escape.

        [ ! -f "$file" ] |(rm -f $file; echo "File \"$file\" deleted.")
        # OR LIST, to delete file if present.

        # Note logic inversion above.
        # AND LIST executes on true, OR LIST on false.

        exit $?






.. caution::

    If the first command in an *or list* returns true , it
    ``                         will                       `` execute.






.. code-block:: sh

    #+==> script by Miquel van Smoorenburg

            [ -x "$i" ].. continue::

      #+==> then "continue" by jumping to the top of the loop.

            case "$1" in
                    *.rpmsave|*.rpmorig|*.rpmnew|*~|*.orig)
                            continue;;
            esac
            [ "$i" = "/etc/rc1.d/S00single" ] && continue
      # ==> Set script name, but don't execute it yet.
            $i start
    done

      # ==> . . .





|Important

The `exit status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`__ of an
``                   and list                 `` or an
``                   or list                 `` is the exit status of
the last command executed.




Clever combinations of *and* and *or* lists are possible, but the logic
may easily become convoluted and require close attention to `operator
precedence rules <opprecedence.html#OPPRECEDENCE1>`__ , and possibly
extensive debugging.


.. code-block:: sh

    false && true |echo false         # false

    # Same result as
    ( false && true ) |echo false     # false
    # But NOT
    false && ( true |echo false )     # (nothing echoed)

    #  Note left-to-right grouping and evaluation of statements.

    #  It's usually best to avoid such complexities.

    #  Thanks, S.C.
