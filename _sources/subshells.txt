XXX  Chapter 21. Subshells
##########################

Running a shell script launches a new process, a *subshell* .



``                   Definition:                 `` A *subshell* is a
`child process <othertypesv.html#CHILDREF2>`__ launched by a shell (or
*shell script* ).




A subshell is a separate instance of the command processor -- the
*shell* that gives you the prompt at the console or in an *xterm*
window. Just as your commands are interpreted at the command-line
prompt, similarly does a script
`batch-process <timedate.html#BATCHPROCREF>`__ a list of commands. Each
shell script running is, in effect, a subprocess ( *child process* ) of
the `parent <internal.html#FORKREF>`__ shell.

A shell script can itself launch subprocesses. These *subshells* let the
script do parallel processing, in effect executing multiple subtasks
simultaneously.


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash
    # subshell-test.sh

    (
    # Inside parentheses, and therefore a subshell . . .
    while [ 1 ]   # Endless loop.
    do
      echo "Subshell running . . ."
    done
    )

    #  Script will run forever,
    #+ or at least until terminated by a Ctl-C.

    exit $?  # End of script (but will never get here).



    Now, run the script:
    sh subshell-test.sh

    And, while the script is running, from a different xterm:
    ps -efgrep subshell-test.sh

    UID       PID   PPID  C STIME TTY      TIME     CMD
    500       2698  2502  0 14:26 pts/4    00:00:00 sh subshell-test.sh
    500       2699  2698 21 14:26 pts/4    00:00:24 sh subshell-test.sh

              ^^^^

    Analysis:
    PID 2698, the script, launched PID 2699, the subshell.

    Note: The "UID ..." line would be filtered out by the "grep" command,
    but is shown here for illustrative purposes.



In general, an `external command <external.html#EXTERNALREF>`__ in a
script `forks off <internal.html#FORKREF>`__ a subprocess, ` [1]
 <subshells.html#FTN.AEN18102>`__ whereas a Bash
`builtin <internal.html#BUILTINREF>`__ does not. For this reason,
builtins execute more quickly and use fewer system resources than their
external command equivalents.


** Command List within Parentheses**

 ( command1; command2; command3; ... )
    A command list embedded between
    ``                   parentheses                 `` runs as a
    subshell.


 Variables in a subshell are *not* visible outside the block of code in
the subshell. They are not accessible to the `parent
process <internal.html#FORKREF>`__ , to the shell that launched the
subshell. These are, in effect, variables
`local <localvar.html#LOCALREF>`__ to the *child process* .


Exemple 1. Variable scope in a subshell
=======================================


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash
    # subshell.sh

    echo

    echo "We are outside the subshell."
    echo "Subshell level OUTSIDE subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL"
    # Bash, version 3, adds the new         $BASH_SUBSHELL variable.
    echo; echo

    outer_variable=Outer
    global_variable=
    #  Define global variable for "storage" of
    #+ value of subshell variable.

    (
    echo "We are inside the subshell."
    echo "Subshell level INSIDE subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL"
    inner_variable=Inner

    echo "From inside subshell, \"inner_variable\" = $inner_variable"
    echo "From inside subshell, \"outer\" = $outer_variable"

    global_variable="$inner_variable"   #  Will this allow "exporting"
                                        #+ a subshell variable?
    )

    echo; echo
    echo "We are outside the subshell."
    echo "Subshell level OUTSIDE subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL"
    echo

    if [ -z "$inner_variable" ]
    then
      echo "inner_variable undefined in main body of shell"
    else
      echo "inner_variable defined in main body of shell"
    fi

    echo "From main body of shell, \"inner_variable\" = $inner_variable"
    #  $inner_variable will show as blank (uninitialized)
    #+ because variables defined in a subshell are "local variables".
    #  Is there a remedy for this?
    echo "global_variable = "$global_variable""  # Why doesn't this work?

    echo

    # =======================================================================

    # Additionally ...

    echo "-----------------"; echo

    var=41                                                 # Global variable.

    ( let "var+=1"; echo "\$var INSIDE subshell = $var" )  # 42

    echo "\$var OUTSIDE subshell = $var"                   # 41
    #  Variable operations inside a subshell, even to a GLOBAL variable
    #+ do not affect the value of the variable outside the subshell!


    exit 0

    #  Question:
    #  --------
    #  Once having exited a subshell,
    #+ is there any way to reenter that very same subshell
    #+ to modify or access the subshell variables?

34-2 <gotchas.html#SUBPIT>`__ .



``                   Definition:                 `` The *scope* of a
variable is the context in which it has meaning, in which it has a
*value* that can be referenced. For example, the scope of a `local
variable <localvar.html#LOCALREF1>`__ lies only within the function,
block of code, or subshell within which it is defined, while the scope
of a *global* variable is the entire script in which it appears.






|Note

While the `$BASH\_SUBSHELL <internalvariables.html#BASHSUBSHELLREF>`__
internal variable indicates the nesting level of a subshell, the
`$SHLVL <internalvariables.html#SHLVLREF>`__ variable *shows no change*
within a subshell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    echo " \$BASH_SUBSHE
LL outside subshell
  = $BASH_SUBSHELL"
      # 0
      ( echo " \$BASH_SU
BSHELL inside subshell
      = $BASH_SUBSHELL"
)     # 1
      ( ( echo " \$BASH_
SUBSHELL inside nested s
ubshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL
" ) ) # 2
    # ^ ^
            *** nested *
**
  ^ ^

    echo

    echo " \$SHLVL outsi
de subshell = $SHLVL"
    # 3
    ( echo " \$SHLVL ins
ide subshell  = $SHLVL"
)   # 3 (No change!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



.. code-block:: sh

    echo " \$BASH_SUBSHELL outside subshell       = $BASH_SUBSHELL"           # 0
      ( echo " \$BASH_SUBSHELL inside subshell        = $BASH_SUBSHELL" )     # 1
      ( ( echo " \$BASH_SUBSHELL inside nested subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL" ) ) # 2
    # ^ ^                           *** nested ***                        ^ ^

    echo

    echo " \$SHLVL outside subshell = $SHLVL"       # 3
    ( echo " \$SHLVL inside subshell  = $SHLVL" )   # 3 (No change!)


.. code-block:: sh

    echo " \$BASH_SUBSHELL outside subshell       = $BASH_SUBSHELL"           # 0
      ( echo " \$BASH_SUBSHELL inside subshell        = $BASH_SUBSHELL" )     # 1
      ( ( echo " \$BASH_SUBSHELL inside nested subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL" ) ) # 2
    # ^ ^                           *** nested ***                        ^ ^

    echo

    echo " \$SHLVL outside subshell = $SHLVL"       # 3
    ( echo " \$SHLVL inside subshell  = $SHLVL" )   # 3 (No change!)




Directory changes made in a subshell do not carry over to the parent
shell.


Exemple 2. List User Profiles
=============================


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash
    # allprofs.sh: Print all user profiles.

    # This script written by Heiner Steven, and modified by the document author.

    FILE=.bashrc  #  File containing user profile,
                  #+ was ".profile" in original script.

    for home in `awk -F: '{print $6}' /etc/passwd`
    do
      [ -d "$home" ] |continue    # If no home directory, go to next.
      [ -r "$home" ] |continue    # If not readable, go to next.
      (cd $home; [ -e $FILE ] && less $FILE)
    done

    #  When script terminates, there is no need to 'cd' back to original directory,
    #+ because 'cd $home' takes place in a subshell.

    exit 0




A subshell may be used to set up a "dedicated environment" for a command
group.


.. code-block:: sh

    COMMAND1
    COMMAND2
    COMMAND3
    (
      IFS=:
      PATH=/bin
      unset TERMINFO
      set -C
      shift 5
      COMMAND4
      COMMAND5
      exit 3 # Only exits the subshell!
    )
    # The parent shell has not been affected, and the environment is preserved.
    COMMAND6
    COMMAND7



As seen here, the `exit <internal.html#EXITREF>`__ command only
terminates the subshell in which it is running, *not* the parent shell
or script.
One application of such a "dedicated environment" is testing whether a
variable is defined.


.. code-block:: sh

    if (set -u; : $variable) 2> /dev/null
    then
      echo "Variable is set."
    fi     #  Variable has been set in current script,
           #+ or is an an internal Bash variable,
           #+ or is present in environment (has been exported).

    # Could also be written [[ ${variable-x} != x |${variable-y} != y ]]
    # or                    [[ ${variable-x} != x$variable ]]
    # or                    [[ ${variable+x} = x ]]
    # or                    [[ ${variable-x} != x ]]



Another application is checking for a lock file:


.. code-block:: sh

    if (set -C; : > lock_file) 2> /dev/null
    then
      :   # lock_file didn't exist: no user running the script
    else
      echo "Another user is already running that script."
    exit 65
    fi

    #  Code snippet by StÃ©phane Chazelas,
    #+ with modifications by Paulo Marcel Coelho Aragao.



+

Processes may execute in parallel within different subshells. This
permits breaking a complex task into subcomponents processed
concurrently.


Exemple 3. Running parallel processes in subshells
==================================================


.. code-block:: sh

     (cat list1 list2 list3sort | uniq > list123) &
        (cat list4 list5 list6sort | uniq > list456) &
        # Merges and sorts both sets of lists simultaneously.
        # Running in background ensures parallel execution.
        #
        # Same effect as
        #   cat list1 list2 list3sort | uniq > list123 &
        #   cat list4 list5 list6sort | uniq > list456 &

        wait   # Don't execute the next command until subshells finish.

        diff list123 list456




Redirecting I/O to a subshell uses the "\|" pipe operator, as in
``             ls -al(command)           `` .



|Note

A code block between `curly
brackets <special-chars.html#CODEBLOCKREF>`__ does *not* launch a
subshell.

{ command1; command2; command3; . . . commandN; }

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    var1=23
    echo "$var1"   # 23

    { var1=76; }
    echo "$var1"   # 76

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



.. code-block:: sh

    var1=23
    echo "$var1"   # 23

    { var1=76; }
    echo "$var1"   # 76


.. code-block:: sh

    var1=23
    echo "$var1"   # 23

    { var1=76; }
    echo "$var1"   # 76





Notes
~~~~~


` [1]  <subshells.html#AEN18102>`__

An external command invoked with an `exec <internal.html#EXECREF>`__
does *not* (usually) fork off a subprocess / subshell.
