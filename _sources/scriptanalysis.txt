XXX  O.1. Analyzing Scripts
###########################

Examine the following script. Run it, then explain what it does.
Annotate the script and rewrite it in a more compact and elegant manner.


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash

    MAX=10000


      for((nr=1; nr<$MAX; nr++))
      do

        let "t1 = nr % 5"
        if [ "$t1" -ne 3 ]
        then
          continue
        fi

        let "t2 = nr % 7"
        if [ "$t2" -ne 4 ]
        then
          continue
        fi

        let "t3 = nr % 9"
        if [ "$t3" -ne 5 ]
        then
          continue
        fi

      break   # What happens when you comment out this line? Why?

      done

      echo "Number = $nr"


    exit 0

Explain what the following script does. It is really just a
parameterized command-line pipe.


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash

    DIRNAME=/usr/bin
    FILETYPE="shell script"
    LOGFILE=logfile

    file "$DIRNAME"/*fgrep "$FILETYPE" | tee $LOGFILE | wc -l

    exit 0



---

Examine and explain the following script. For hints, you might refer to
the listings for `find <moreadv.html#FINDREF>`__ and
`stat <system.html#STATREF>`__ .


.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/bash

    # Author:  Nathan Coulter
    # This code is released to the public domain.
    # The author gave permission to use this code snippet in the ABS Guide.

    find -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf '%f\000'{
       while read -d $'\000'; do
          mv "$REPLY" "$(date -d "$(stat -c '%y' "$REPLY") " '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S'
          )-$REPLY"
       done
    }

    # Warning: Test-drive this script in a "scratch" directory.
    # It will somehow affect all the files there.

A reader sent in the following code snippet.


.. code-block:: sh

    while read LINE
    do
      echo $LINE
    done < `tail -f /var/log/messages`



He wished to write a script tracking changes to the system log file,
``      /var/log/messages     `` . Unfortunately, the above code block
hangs and does nothing useful. Why? Fix this so it does work. (Hint:
rather than `redirecting the ``       stdin      `` of the
loop <redircb.html#REDIRREF>`__ , try a
`pipe <special-chars.html#PIPEREF>`__ .)

---

Analyze the following "one-liner" (here split into two lines for
clarity) contributed by Rory Winston:


.. code-block:: sh

    export SUM=0; for f in $(find src -name "*.java");
    do export SUM=$(($SUM + $(wc -l $fawk '{ print $1 }'))); done; echo $SUM



Hint: First, break the script up into bite-sized sections. Then,
carefully examine its use of `double-parentheses <dblparens.html>`__
arithmetic, the `export <internal.html#EXPORTREF>`__ command, the
`find <moreadv.html#FINDREF>`__ command, the
`wc <textproc.html#WCREF>`__ command, and `awk <awk.html#AWKREF>`__ .

---

Analyze `Example A-10 <contributed-scripts.html#LIFESLOW>`__ , and
reorganize it in a simplified and more logical style. See how many of
the variables can be eliminated, and try to optimize the script to speed
up its execution time.

Alter the script so that it accepts any ordinary ASCII text file as
input for its initial "generation" . The script will read the first
``             $ROW*$COL           `` characters, and set the
occurrences of vowels as "living" cells. Hint: be sure to translate the
spaces in the input file to underscore characters.
