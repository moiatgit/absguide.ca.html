XXX  16.1. Basic Commands
#########################


** The first commands a novice learns**

 **ls**
    The basic file "list" command. It is all too easy to underestimate
    the power of this humble command. For example, using the
    ``         -R        `` , recursive option, **ls** provides a
    tree-like listing of a directory structure. Other useful options are
    ``         -S        `` , sort listing by file size,
    ``         -t        `` , sort by file modification time,
    ``         -v        `` , sort by (numerical) version numbers
    embedded in the filenames, ` [1]  <basic.html#FTN.AEN10025>`__
    ``         -b        `` , show escape characters, and
    ``         -i        `` , show file inodes (see `Example
    16-4 <moreadv.html#IDELETE>`__ ).

.. tip::

    The *ls* command returns a non-zero `exit
    status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`__ when attempting to list a
    non-existent file.


.. code-block:: sh

    bash$ ls abc
    ls: abc: No such fil
e or directory


    bash$ echo $?
    2




    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ ls abc
        ls: abc: No such file or directory


        bash$ echo $?
        2


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ ls abc
        ls: abc: No such file or directory


        bash$ echo $?
        2





Exemple 1. Using *ls* to create a table of contents for burning a CDR disk
==========================================================================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # ex40.sh (burn-cd.sh)
        # Script to automate burning a CDR.


        SPEED=10         # May use higher speed if your hardware supports it.
        IMAGEFILE=cdimage.iso
        CONTENTSFILE=contents
        # DEVICE=/dev/cdrom     For older versions of cdrecord
        DEVICE="1,0,0"
        DEFAULTDIR=/opt  # This is the directory containing the data to be burned.
                         # Make sure it exists.
                         # Exercise: Add a test for this.

        # Uses Joerg Schilling's "cdrecord" package:
        # http://www.fokus.fhg.de/usr/schilling/cdrecord.html

        #  If this script invoked as an ordinary user, may need to suid cdrecord
        #+ chmod u+s /usr/bin/cdrecord, as root.
        #  Of course, this creates a security hole, though a relatively minor one.

        if [ -z "$1" ]
        then
          IMAGE_DIRECTORY=$DEFAULTDIR
          # Default directory, if not specified on command-line.
        else
            IMAGE_DIRECTORY=$1
        fi

        # Create a "table of contents" file.
        ls -lRF $IMAGE_DIRECTORY > $IMAGE_DIRECTORY/$CONTENTSFILE
        # The "l" option gives a "long" file listing.
        # The "R" option makes the listing recursive.
        # The "F" option marks the file types (directories get a trailing /).
        echo "Creating table of contents."

        # Create an image file preparatory to burning it onto the CDR.
        mkisofs -r -o $IMAGEFILE $IMAGE_DIRECTORY
        echo "Creating ISO9660 file system image ($IMAGEFILE)."

        # Burn the CDR.
        echo "Burning the disk."
        echo "Please be patient, this will take a while."
        wodim -v -isosize dev=$DEVICE $IMAGEFILE
        #  In newer Linux distros, the "wodim" utility assumes the
        #+ functionality of "cdrecord."
        exitcode=$?
        echo "Exit code = $exitcode"

        exit $exitcode




 **cat** , **tac**
    **cat** , an acronym for *concatenate* , lists a file to
    ``         stdout        `` . When combined with redirection ( > or
    >> ), it is commonly used to concatenate files.


    .. code-block:: sh

        # Uses of 'cat'
        cat filename                          # Lists the file.

        cat file.1 file.2 file.3 > file.123   # Combines three files into one.



    The ``        -n       `` option to **cat** inserts consecutive
    numbers before all lines of the target file(s). The
    ``        -b       `` option numbers only the non-blank lines. The
    ``        -v       `` option echoes nonprintable characters, using ^
    notation. The ``        -s       `` option squeezes multiple
    consecutive blank lines into a single blank line.

    See also `Example 16-28 <textproc.html#LNUM>`__ and `Example
    16-24 <textproc.html#ROT13>`__ .



.. note::

     In a `pipe <special-chars.html#PIPEREF>`__ , it may be more
    efficient to `redirect <io-redirection.html#IOREDIRREF>`__ the
    ``            stdin           `` to a file, rather than to **cat**
    the file.


.. code-block:: sh

    cat filename | tr a-
z A-Z

    tr a-z A-Z < filenam
e   #  Same effect, but
starts one less process,

    #+ and also dispense
s with the pipe.




    .. code-block:: sh

        cat filenametr a-z A-Z

        tr a-z A-Z < filename   #  Same effect, but starts one less process,
                                #+ and also dispenses with the pipe.


    .. code-block:: sh

        cat filenametr a-z A-Z

        tr a-z A-Z < filename   #  Same effect, but starts one less process,
                                #+ and also dispenses with the pipe.




    **tac** , is the inverse of *cat* , listing a file backwards from
    its end.

 **rev**
    reverses each line of a file, and outputs to
    ``         stdout        `` . This does not have the same effect as
    **tac** , as it preserves the order of the lines, but flips each one
    around (mirror image).


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ cat file1.txt
        This is line 1.
         This is line 2.


        bash$ tac file1.txt
        This is line 2.
         This is line 1.


        bash$ rev file1.txt
        .1 enil si sihT
         .2 enil si sihT




 **cp**
    This is the file copy command.
    ``                   cp file1           file2                 ``
    copies ``         file1        `` to ``         file2        `` ,
    overwriting ``         file2        `` if it already exists (see
    `Example 16-6 <moreadv.html#EX42>`__ ).



.. tip::

    Particularly useful are the ``            -a           `` archive
    flag (for copying an entire directory tree), the
    ``            -u           `` update flag (which prevents
    overwriting identically-named newer files), and the
    ``            -r           `` and ``            -R           ``
    recursive flags.


.. code-block:: sh

    cp -u source_dir/* d
est_dir
    #  "Synchronize" des
t_dir to source_dir
    #+  by copying over
all newer and not previo
usly existing files.




    .. code-block:: sh

        cp -u source_dir/* dest_dir
        #  "Synchronize" dest_dir to source_dir
        #+  by copying over all newer and not previously existing files.


    .. code-block:: sh

        cp -u source_dir/* dest_dir
        #  "Synchronize" dest_dir to source_dir
        #+  by copying over all newer and not previously existing files.




 **mv**
    This is the file *move* command. It is equivalent to a combination
    of **cp** and **rm** . It may be used to move multiple files to a
    directory, or even to rename a directory. For some examples of using
    **mv** in a script, see `Example
    10-11 <parameter-substitution.html#RFE>`__ and `Example
    A-2 <contributed-scripts.html#RN>`__ .



.. note::

    When used in a non-interactive script, **mv** takes the
    ``            -f           `` ( *force* ) option to bypass user
    input.

    When a directory is moved to a preexisting directory, it becomes a
    subdirectory of the destination directory.


.. code-block:: sh

    bash$ mv source_dire
ctory target_directory

    bash$ ls -lF target_
directory
    total 1
     drwxrwxr-x    2 boz
o  bozo      1024 May 28
 19:20 source_directory/





    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ mv source_directory target_directory

        bash$ ls -lF target_directory
        total 1
         drwxrwxr-x    2 bozo  bozo      1024 May 28 19:20 source_directory/



    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ mv source_directory target_directory

        bash$ ls -lF target_directory
        total 1
         drwxrwxr-x    2 bozo  bozo      1024 May 28 19:20 source_directory/





 **rm**
    Delete (remove) a file or files. The ``         -f        `` option
    forces removal of even readonly files, and is useful for bypassing
    user input in a script.



.. note::

    The *rm* command will, by itself, fail to remove filenames beginning
    with a dash. Why? Because *rm* sees a dash-prefixed filename as an
    *option* .


.. code-block:: sh

    bash$ rm -badname
    rm: invalid option -
- b
     Try `rm --help' for
 more information.



    One clever workaround is to precede the filename with a " -- " (the
    *end-of-options* flag).


.. code-block:: sh

    bash$ rm -- -badname



    Another method to is to preface the filename to be removed with a
    ``            dot-slash           `` .


.. code-block:: sh

    bash$ rm ./-badname




    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ rm -badname
        rm: invalid option -- b
         Try `rm --help' for more information.


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ rm -- -badname


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ rm ./-badname


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ rm -badname
        rm: invalid option -- b
         Try `rm --help' for more information.


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ rm -- -badname


    .. code-block:: sh

        bash$ rm ./-badname






.. warning::

     When used with the recursive flag ``            -r           `` ,
    this command removes files all the way down the directory tree from
    the current directory. A careless **rm -rf \*** can wipe out a big
    chunk of a directory structure.




 **rmdir**
    Remove directory. The directory must be empty of all files --
    including "invisible" *dotfiles* ` [2]  <basic.html#FTN.AEN10228>`__
    -- for this command to succeed.

 **mkdir**
    Make directory, creates a new directory. For example,
    ``                   mkdir -p project/programs/December                 ``
    creates the named directory. The
    ``                   -p                 `` option automatically
    creates any necessary parent directories.

 **chmod**
    Changes the attributes of an existing file or directory (see
    `Example 15-14 <internal.html#EX44>`__ ).


    .. code-block:: sh

        chmod +x filename
        # Makes "filename" executable for all users.

        chmod u+s filename
        # Sets "suid" bit on "filename" permissions.
        # An ordinary user may execute "filename" with same privileges as the file's owner.
        # (This does not apply to shell scripts.)




    .. code-block:: sh

        chmod 644 filename
        #  Makes "filename" readable/writable to owner, readable to others
        #+ (octal mode).

        chmod 444 filename
        #  Makes "filename" read-only for all.
        #  Modifying the file (for example, with a text editor)
        #+ not allowed for a user who does not own the file (except for root),
        #+ and even the file owner must force a file-save
        #+ if she modifies the file.
        #  Same restrictions apply for deleting the file.




    .. code-block:: sh

        chmod 1777 directory-name
        #  Gives everyone read, write, and execute permission in directory,
        #+ however also sets the "sticky bit".
        #  This means that only the owner of the directory,
        #+ owner of the file, and, of course, root
        #+ can delete any particular file in that directory.

        chmod 111 directory-name
        #  Gives everyone execute-only permission in a directory.
        #  This means that you can execute and READ the files in that directory
        #+ (execute permission necessarily includes read permission
        #+ because you can't execute a file without being able to read it).
        #  But you can't list the files or search for them with the "find" command.
        #  These restrictions do not apply to root.

        chmod 000 directory-name
        #  No permissions at all for that directory.
        #  Can't read, write, or execute files in it.
        #  Can't even list files in it or "cd" to it.
        #  But, you can rename (mv) the directory
        #+ or delete it (rmdir) if it is empty.
        #  You can even symlink to files in the directory,
        #+ but you can't read, write, or execute the symlinks.
        #  These restrictions do not apply to root.



 **chattr**
    **Ch** ange file **attr** ibutes. This is analogous to **chmod**
    above, but with different options and a different invocation syntax,
    and it works only on *ext2/ext3* filesystems.

    One particularly interesting **chattr** option is
    ``         i        `` . A **chattr +i
    ``          filename         ``** marks the file as immutable. The
    file cannot be modified, linked to, or deleted, *not even by root* .
    This file attribute can be set or removed only by *root* . In a
    similar fashion, the ``         a        `` option marks the file as
    append only.


    .. code-block:: sh

        root# chattr +i file1.txt


        root# rm file1.txt

        rm: remove write-protected regular file `file1.txt'? y
         rm: cannot remove `file1.txt': Operation not permitted




    If a file has the ``         s        `` (secure) attribute set,
    then when it is deleted its block is overwritten with binary zeroes.
    ` [3]  <basic.html#FTN.AEN10301>`__

    If a file has the ``         u        `` (undelete) attribute set,
    then when it is deleted, its contents can still be retrieved
    (undeleted).

    If a file has the ``         c        `` (compress) attribute set,
    then it will automatically be compressed on writes to disk, and
    uncompressed on reads.



.. note::

    The file attributes set with **chattr** do not show in a file
    listing ( **ls -l** ).




 **ln**
    Creates links to pre-existings files. A "link" is a reference to a
    file, an alternate name for it. The **ln** command permits
    referencing the linked file by more than one name and is a superior
    alternative to aliasing (see `Example 4-6 <othertypesv.html#EX18>`__
    ).

    The **ln** creates only a reference, a pointer to the file only a
    few bytes in size.

    The **ln** command is most often used with the
    ``         -s        `` , symbolic or "soft" link flag. Advantages
    of using the ``         -s        `` flag are that it permits
    linking across file systems or to directories.

    The syntax of the command is a bit tricky. For example:
    ``                   ln -s oldfile newfile                 `` links
    the previously existing ``         oldfile        `` to the newly
    created link, ``         newfile        `` .



.. caution::

    If a file named ``            newfile           `` has previously
    existed, an error message will result.






    **Which type of link to use?**

    As John Macdonald explains it:

    Both of these [types of links] provide a certain measure of dual
    reference -- if you edit the contents of the file using any name,
    your changes will affect both the original name and either a hard or
    soft new name. The differences between them occurs when you work at
    a higher level. The advantage of a hard link is that the new name is
    totally independent of the old name -- if you remove or rename the
    old name, that does not affect the hard link, which continues to
    point to the data while it would leave a soft link hanging pointing
    to the old name which is no longer there. The advantage of a soft
    link is that it can refer to a different file system (since it is
    just a reference to a file name, not to actual data). And, unlike a
    hard link, a symbolic link can refer to a directory.




    Links give the ability to invoke a script (or any other type of
    executable) with multiple names, and having that script behave
    according to how it was invoked.


Exemple 2. Hello or Good-bye
============================


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # hello.sh: Saying "hello" or "goodbye"
        #+          depending on how script is invoked.

        # Make a link in current working directory ($PWD) to this script:
        #    ln -s hello.sh goodbye
        # Now, try invoking this script both ways:
        # ./hello.sh
        # ./goodbye


        HELLO_CALL=65
        GOODBYE_CALL=66

        if [ $0 = "./goodbye" ]
        then
          echo "Good-bye!"
          # Some other goodbye-type commands, as appropriate.
          exit $GOODBYE_CALL
        fi

        echo "Hello!"
        # Some other hello-type commands, as appropriate.
        exit $HELLO_CALL




 **man** , **info**
    These commands access the manual and information pages on system
    commands and installed utilities. When available, the *info* pages
    usually contain more detailed descriptions than do the *man* pages.

    There have been various attempts at "automating" the writing of *man
    pages* . For a script that makes a tentative first step in that
    direction, see `Example A-39 <contributed-scripts.html#MANED>`__ .



Notes
~~~~~


` [1]  <basic.html#AEN10025>`__

The ``       -v      `` option also orders the sort by *upper- and
lowercase prefixed* filenames.


` [2]  <basic.html#AEN10228>`__

*Dotfiles* are files whose names begin with a *dot* , such as
``       ~/.Xdefaults      `` . Such filenames do not appear in a normal
**ls** listing (although an **ls -a** will show them), and they cannot
be deleted by an accidental **rm -rf \*** . Dotfiles are generally used
as setup and configuration files in a user's home directory.


` [3]  <basic.html#AEN10301>`__

This particular feature may not yet be implemented in the version of the
ext2/ext3 filesystem installed on your system. Check the documentation
for your Linux distro.
